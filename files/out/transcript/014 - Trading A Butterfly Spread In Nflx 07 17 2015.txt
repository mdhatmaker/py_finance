 I Make it we're back Where do I start back first back back to bat how are you good? How are you good everything all right? Yeah? It's good. It's Friday. Can't be too uh too unhappy. I saw you in the makeup room getting makeup put on Take a pictures and everything like that. Was that you yeah, you got to look good come on. You didn't have any makeup I'm just teasing you. You days, okay? Yeah, all right my positions are kind of um, I've got a Close touch close to being a touch on my Costco call that I sold Okay, 45, but I still got time on it, so okay, so does it concern you all? All my mean of course it's a little bit uh concerning, but I I'll keep I'll keep the time and and deal with it, you know if it gets any closer or worse all right Well, let's put your account up distance you mentioned it But I really want to talk about and get a trade put on for you in a butterfly, but we'll mention it Go to um, that's your screen right neck. Yeah, okay. Let's go to Open up the trade just so we could see what the strike so that's perfect So you shut the 145 call stocks right about 145 will just round up But you sold that call for $2.17. So your break even is is what? Um Plus 217 on top of 147 17 plus the 60 cents that you sold for the put brings you up to 147 You know 77 it's called 147 80 correct, okay, so yeah Remember something We'd never discussed this, but if you sell an option would a 30% which is about the range that we always go into 30 35 25% So we're in that that range if you sell an option with a 30% probability of being Uh, in the money. What do you think the probability of a touches like what do you think the probability of a stock in that time frame touching your short strike? Like what portion of that percentage or just overall overall if there's a 30% chance That it's gonna be in the money. What's the probability of a touch? It's double So it's a there's a there's a 60% chance that the stock is gonna hit that strike So when you sell a call you sell a put bullish or bearish it doesn't matter to me Your strike Is more than likely going to be tested that doesn't mean the trade has to be a losing trade Your put your call looks like it's trading it around 229 229 so it is a small loser because you just sold it four or five days ago The stock hasn't had a down-ticks that you sold it yeah, but yet the overall position has a gain to it But let's need a here and there when you sold that call if it had a 35 delta There's about a 70% chance. It's gonna be gonna be a touch of that strike So it's it's it's a foregone conclusion that that's probably gonna happen Does that make sense yeah, all right cool So keep that in mind for a moment because I want to show you something It's your computer. So let's go to let's go to you Let's go to let's go to Netflix. Let's go on the trade page Are you really are concerned about this Costco because you've been you have it up there on the screen It's the last thing you checked okay. What do you have up there? um I've got a short call butterfly Short call butterfly and possibly just get out of that. I'm not I'm not yeah, that's okay. Click on straight stop Believe what you have there. I you cleared it. All right Yeah, stop stop stop stop clicking around you get more crazy Click on the strategies to release that up on the top left. There you go. Okay now stop now go to the right there on your screen And you see where it says undo on the top top right right there go to the left. There you go Stop that button allows you to click back and forth to what you used to have on in your platform So if you move something you like it and then all of a sudden you know you don't like it anymore You can go back and forth and change the strikes. We have it. Okay, and other way you could do like a redo too You can you can redo right and go back very good all right, so All right, so I see things here that I don't like I'm gonna tell you why First you have a butterfly strategy up there, which is great We never sell butterflies That's a that's a short butterfly we only buy butterflies they trade very very cheap They Probability of success Which means if you sold them like you want to do here it has a very high probability of success But the risk reward Isn't that great meaning you could make 45 cents in the spread that you have up there it looks like you can lose around $3 Is that correct for yeah for with $3 Yeah, three 12 okay So we don't do that all right We buy butterflies and we buy butterflies Typically when there's a high implied volatility Why do you think we would buy butterflies in a high implied volatility Um Because they're the markets expecting a price move in the In the other line that's awesome and since they they this is great Since they since they expect a large window of movement they trade cheaper Said does that make does that make sense because nobody they're dependent flip that over if you could um Make it a buy You can just To a long call yeah, okay, that's fine however you did it at a little time You like clicking around on the button, so yeah, you're really like a new toy for you, huh Now you're in the wrong month you were in the you were in the 42 days before yeah, so here I'm at 42 days here Okay, I don't think that's the same when you had up there, but it doesn't matter me. Oh, I'd yeah My man, it's okay. You know, you know what you could have done Right what you could have just oh yeah, I could have done my him my undo. Yeah, you could have done your undo You could have you could have flipped them over there on the on the swap see up on top there right there oops go click it They see it changes it from by itself A lot less clicks, but you know you you know you young kids with your with your games you like to click around Try on air try on air okay, but now you learn you really see introduced you remember the the swap button Okay, so we always buy butterflies a butterfly is the combination of a long call spread Uh in the example you have up there is the 112 in change and you're selling You got to throw on flip now again. There you go Wow, I'm gonna think for for the next couple days we're gonna have somebody else drive for a while So so we can get something done here. All right, so you're buying a call spread That's the 112 in change call and selling the 115 you notice it's one by two by one. Do you see that two on the cell So you're buying one call spread and you're selling another call spread equal distance away I don't think you have equal distance away there, but that's that's neither here nor there. That's a classic butterfly All right, so you have 42 days up there We trade monthlies and I've told you this before so stop looking So anywhere else for a trade that's not in the monthlies the monthlies have 35 days to go You're trying to set it so that it doesn't uh Yeah, to show only uh the regular Explorations which they say working with your child is a gift Uh-huh All right, so how's this experiment working for you So I'm at um here I got the monthlies very good August 21. Okay, click them So now what do you have up there you can stay right we're at the table now now you got the table switch on around do you have ADD? I think you have ADD do you? all right, so So can I show you what we do? All right, so get rid of that one by that you have up there and you know what get rid of the whole Hold it get rid of the whole thing clear fresh. Thank you All right, all right, you can stay right where you are if you want to I want to click the buttons though. I know how you want to click the buttons All right, so remember I told you yesterday I showed you a spread that we didn't want to pay any extrinsic value over the Stock price Let's buy the 111 43 call so you can click on buying the 111 43 call Uh, okay, and now let's click on selling the 116 43 call It's gonna be down a little bit Right there Okay, now try to make it so that everybody can see what you're buying on the other stop right there Okay, so that spread is trading for about two dollars and 70 cents now. I know that the strikes are a little bit odd in there. So What's the Is there any extrinsic Value on that spread And you know how to figure it out $2.70 is what the price is mm-hmm, and you got amany use one 111 43 is the strike that you're buying Plus two seven day, right? Yes, that puts me at 114 $3.13 $13 $13.13 So that's Below what the current price is to us now change it to the curvy leave leave all the options and then just click on a curvy To us we consider that a 50 50 shot and that's exactly what the computer shows you it's a 50 50 shot You'll notice that your green line is below Where the stock price is trading at the green Uh, little teardrop there is where the stock is trading at so to us that's basically a 50 50 shot That's a stock substitution for us. So I'm only risking $270 To make just about $200 and change click review and send one time So you so you're risking $270 to make $230 We're doing a call vertical here though. That's a call vertical And I'm not really necessarily bullish on Netflix, but I but I want to and I'm actually bearish but get rid of that So click the X on the top right Either way Perfect. Okay, go back to the table view All right, so now I want to add remember I told you a butterfly is a long call spread there's a long call spread And the combination of a short call spread So make that short call that you have the one 1643s make it two contracts All right, uh, you have to You have to click it. Okay Now we're going to buy something if we were doing a regular butterfly We'd have to buy something five dollars away because that spread is five dollars wide correct from the first call From the daughter call that we're buying five From there or from the one that we're selling From the one that you're selling why because the one that you're buying is five dollars away from the one you're selling Okay, so it's gonna make ten points It's gonna be ten dollars wide, but we call that a five dollar wide butterfly Okay, okay, because it's your short strike where do you want the stock to go Stay there you want to stay in the range you want the stock to go right to your short strike Just about every strategy we do you want the stock to go to your short strike For the sake of time because we're running out of it If I wanted to buy a regular butterfly I would buy the next call five dollars out of the money Okay, I want you to buy the call that's ten dollars out of the money So go to the one 26 43 call And you had to click on buy Perfect you Perfect, you're good. Yeah, I'm good. You're good. What do we paint go back to the curve view for a moment? Uh, that says debit change the debit to a credit I can Give it a second to refresh if it will Okay, go back You just have to you have to click it or make it zero or something like that you get to here. Yeah There we go. No You're fine perfect leave it like that just leave like that. It's got a one-cent credit perfect Okay, what I want to show you is that was a three-cent debit so you have risk on both sides But your risk on one side all the way to the downside was only three cents three dollars Here if you do it for a credit your risk to the downside is zero So you go from a 50 50 shot to a 70 30 shot your way you still want the stock to paint at your short strike Because that's where you'll make the most money, but you make money all the way down I want you to find a butterfly spread That you're buying one side five dollars selling another side ten dollars where your call is out of the money And you're able to do it for a credit that's your homework assignment then make the trade and push it through because I got other shows to do all right Let's try to let's try to go over Uh, can I push this or no that doesn't meet your criteria. I said you're gonna find your own strikes I said you said you go out like I said push this one through and then find another one I need You're one lot Johnny trader. You don't trade two lots one lot All right, you're four days in for crying out loud You can read up there what a butterfly spread is you should probably go over the segment again Because I don't think you'll pay attention you're clicking around too much You see what a butterfly spread is a broken wing butterfly spread is just making that uh shorter side wider To finance and I hate that word but to finance what you're paying for the for the five dollar wide original Spread and that spread could be any with doesn't have to be five dollars where this is I'm using for Netflix Okay, where's your risk on that trade? Um, to either either on this one or like in general Not a broken wing who cares about the bottom of the upside if it goes bullish perfect So where do you want to start to go down or stay the same very good I'm hard working with you. It's tough working with him too What do we say till next peace
