 We're back. Where do I start? Bat vs. Bat? How are you today? It's going okay today. I'm seeing a little bit of green on some of my positions, but it's still not where I want to be. Okay, that's okay. So listen, is trading easier tough? It's tough. It's definitely tough, but I mean... So what would you have said about a month ago or something like that or six weeks ago when you first started? What would you say about trading? No, I would have said like let's go shopping because I mean it's some good trades. Right. And it seems like easier from the outside, doesn't it? Yeah. Like if you're watching from the outside and you haven't done anything, oh, markets are going to high low. You buy here, you sell here. It's a lot different when you have money on the line. You got to make the decision. Yeah, and this has been like, I mean my first significant loss. This is a bigger loss I think Katie ever had and she was trading for like two years. Let's take a look at your account there and she was my first student that we had live on the show. So you're really overperforming. Depends on how you look at it. I'm just kidding, your son. You're up about 700 bucks in your account for today. You're down about $3,000 overall. I was talking to you a little bit before the show started. I don't really like to do that. But I was saying, you know what? You don't have a lot of you don't have a lot of beta in your account that's going to like help you make back that money unless you get real big directional moves in the direction that you need in the stocks that kind of hurt you. You know, I mean like you don't have enough premium that you can sell to make up $3,000. It's trading small without taking on limit without taking extra large amount of risks in your account to make up that. So you got to think to yourself, okay, it's going to be a longer time horizon. It might take me the rest of the year. It might take me six months. It might take me three months depending on how volatility goes. It might take you five months and you get lucky on a couple of plays and volatility works your direction too. It's not a hopeless cause, but you just witnessed over the last couple of days something that Katie, when we were doing it, never experienced in her life and something that traders for the last five or seven years have never traded and have never experienced in their life, which is basically a two or three standard deviation. I mean a stock like when has moved 30% in the last three weeks. It gives me nightmares. Right. It's not like, you know, it's a biotech stock that lost a patent or something like that or didn't get approved on something. I mean, it's it's an established stock. Yeah. But at least you have a respect now for the market. Now yesterday, we went through an intrinsic and extrinsic value and I never got to my takeaway on what I wanted to talk about. So I wanted to use the example and the takeaway in win today. So let's go to win and we can talk about that. Now I'll just while you're while you're going there, I'll just and change that from intrinsic to tasty trade on the top. I'm sorry on the top. There you go. Okay. So, a strangle gone gone bad. You keep rolling down the untested side. Let's go to September. Let's go to state September show. We have, I'm sorry. Now you can change return on capital to the position. I apologize. It's like the 90 put and 81 call. So you're inverted. Let's take a look at the 90 put for a minute. Yesterday we talked about intrinsic and extrinsic value and I hope that I drove home the point for you. But let's see if I did. How much extrinsic value does the 90 put have 60 cents? Right. Well, and how are you getting that number? It's the it's the call side. You're just looking at the call side. Whatever the call side is trading for, that's going to they mirror each other. So here. So click on position. Instead of position, make it intrinsic value. Well, you know what I'm sorry, make it extrinsic value. You'll be able to see it on the put a little bit easier. Okay. So the extrinsic value in the put is 61 cents. You notice the 95 or the 90 and a half put there. It shows an extrinsic value of a dollar 26. But the 90 and a half call has how much extrinsic value? No, 57 cents, 58 cents. So you know that something's not wrong there, but that market is so much wider than that 90 and a half put. Now the reason why I wanted to show you this little trade hack about how we find intrinsic and extrinsic value very quickly, change that extrinsic value back to the positions, please. Is because when you're rolling an option that's deep in the money and you have wide markets, even in something like a $73 stock like when price discovery, especially if you only have one contract, is going to be paramount. It's going to be king. Plus if you can understand how to get that price, then you'll forever be, never have to be at the mercy of the market. You'll always know what a good market is. And by good market, I just mean a fair and just one. So let's roll. Remember, all options September, October, November, December are exactly the same. We tried going through that a little bit yesterday. If I'm looking at a put that's trading for $20 and the call is trading for $1 on the same strike, it's going to have $1 of extrinsic value with no dividend in the stock. There's no dividend here. Okay. Let's buy back the 90 put and roll it to September. Now you should be, I should roll it to October. So all we're doing is we're trying to buy ourselves some time and get a little bit of premium. Now take a look at the 90 put for a moment here in October. So you're short to September. We're going to buy that one back. And at the same time, if we wanted to do this, we would sell the October 90 put. The call in September was trading for around 60 cents. Do you remember that? Yes. What's the extrinsic value in the 90 put? Let's say 140. So 60 and 140, 60 minus 140, about 80 cents. Let's click on the 80 put, selling it. So the credit received here is 75 cents. Okay. That's in the ballpark. Yeah. Because we know change that put to call right there. Yes. And it should be around the same price. Now we figured out that it was going to be 80 cents. And when we went to the put side, click it again. It said 75 cents. So if I was looking to put this, if I was looking to do this trade, I would probably route this order at 81, 82, 80, 79 cents. But I wouldn't route it at 77 cents. Because it's probably worth a little bit more. Does that make sense? It's understating the extrinsic value. Well, here, now, now the market's got tight enough where it's basically perfect. But what will happen is when you're trying to roll a trade like this or you're trading a product that has really wide markets and you don't know how to do your own price discovery, your own market awareness, because you know that one mirrors the other, you put something in a mid price. If you put something in a 90 cents right here, you say, well, it's mid price. I should be filled. You know what? I'm going to move it down four or five cents off of mid price. I'm going to go down to 85 cents right here. And look, it's a dollar now. Yeah. You're not going to get filled because that's that is the true market. But it's not the fair market. Click on the change that put to call again. It's really around 83 cents. So a lot of times I'll get emails from people and say, hey, you know, I'm in at mid price or I've actually moved it, you know, two or three cents off of mid price. And we always talk about how in liquid products, and I would consider when a liquid product, how you typically get filled, especially when there's really no delta risk here, look at the delta on the, you can change position from 90 to delta. The delta on the 90 put here in October is 81 in September. It's probably going to be 90 go up to September. So there's no delta risk to the counterparty. Meaning it's basically just a carry trade. How long do I want to carry this for for the amount of it? You know, it's 89. So there's no delta risk. So if the stock were to move a dollar, this spread is not going to move much. It's going to maybe move a penny. It makes sense. There's no risk to the other side. So all we need to know is what's fair value. And the only way to get fair value in deep products like this here, go to Amazon for a moment. I'm just going to Amazon because of $500 stock. And I don't think there are too many people that are naked short options, especially put options because it takes so much buying power. But let's just say that you are, let's go deep in the money for a minute, like go up to $5.50 or something like that. Let's see. You can stay right there. $5.40 is fine. Look at how wide that market is on the $5.40 puts. It's almost $3.00. Yeah. I mean, it's really wide. So if I want here, buy the September 540 put and sell the October 540 put. Let's just say for argument, say, I'm just simulating a trade right now that you had a position in Amazon and you wanted to roll it from September to October. The credit you're receiving here is $5.65. Let's change the put to call. It should be if that pricing, look at how wide the market is. $3.40 to $5.77. Let's change it to call. Well, it's a dollar difference. $6.15. But here, you only have a 25 cent wide market, 30 cent wide market. Now it's $0.35. Do you understand what I'm saying? So from a change back to puts, to do the put side, you've got an over $2.30 wide market. Much harder to do price discovery. Go to call side. So the call side is trading for $6.15. That means the put side, change back to puts, should be trading somewhere around $6.15. So a lot of times what will happen is somebody will put an order in a $5.50, get filled at $5.80 or $6.75 and say, wow, I got a great fill. Did they get a great fill? Probably not. They probably sold it too cheap. Now that's assuming that there's no dividends or anything else like that. If you have dividends and you have to add the dividend into the stock, put side you really don't usually have dividend issue because there's no puts don't have dividend. If you're sure to put, nobody's going to put stock to you so you can collect the dividend. So the put side typically trades true. The call side would not trade true if there was a dividend in September. We can get the dividends when we face that. Okay. Yeah. Alright. So that's why I want to teach you intrinsic and extrinsic value today. I know we didn't make a trade in your account today. Let's go back to your account statement tab for a moment. You're a minor tab. I apologize. Alright, so you're up $850 markets rallying a little bit. You're definitely holding long deltas. Let's beta weight your position. SPY. You probably have about 100 deltas. You got 95 now. Okay. So you look at what you've opened up my Santo for a moment. Your my Santo is making a bid for a company. We rolled down the calls to 95. It probably costs us about 150 bucks in there. But you know what? You want the stock to be around 95 at expiration. There's nothing you can do. When we didn't, we did roll down. Go to win. And the stock still down $1.50 today. So, you know, we're zicking when we should zag. We said we're zagging when we should zig. But we're still doing all the mechanical things that let the let the large, large, large numbers come into play. Alright. So we got to do something with win. So your options are to roll down your call like we typically do. Do nothing or roll the whole position to October. There's no wrong answer. I actually personally think you should just sit and do nothing. If the stock rallies, then we can do it into strength. That would be my opinion. Alright, let's take a quick break here for just a second or just just go over what we talked about today. So today was kind of a two-parter. I didn't finish what I my whole thought yesterday. But we had to learn about intrinsic and extrinsic value so that we could then learn a little bit of a trade hack on how to price deep in the money options when you have to roll them or just price them out. Period. If you wanted to buy a deep in the money option or sell a deep in the in the money option, you know if it has a wide market that's $3, $4 wide, all you have to figure out is the intrinsic value and then how much the other side is trading for to get the fair and true price of that option or the spread that you want it, the count spread that you would want to sell. Okay? Yeah. Alright, good job, Addy based on. And a better job out of your account too. Hey, listen, you got you got back 20% of your losses. Has it make you feel? That's a lot better. Still a long way to go. Yes you do. What do I normally say? Peace. Peace. See you next time.
