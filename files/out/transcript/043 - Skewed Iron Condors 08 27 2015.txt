 We're back. Where do I start? Bat versus bat. How are you? Good. I'm having, I mean, the last couple days have been better for me, account wise. Still making adjustments. I rolled down stinks, doesn't it? I know. It's really a pain, but... So when you say you make an adjustments, it's because you're accounts not performing the way you want it to, or positions, deltas getting too large. Your portfolio has changed. I mean, that's the dynamic thing about trading, and that's really the dynamic thing about options. You know, if you buy 100 shares of ABC stock, it's always going to be 100 shares. You've defined your risk on entry by buying or selling 100 shares of stock. With options, they change. What could be neutral or negative delta one day, especially when you're getting two 300 point moves in the Dow and 50, 60 point moves in the E-Mini S&Ps, which your first two weeks of trading, we were having $5 ranges. Now we're having $50 ranges. A one standard deviation move was something that was a mythical animal that we would talk about. You had a four, five, and six standard deviation moves in a lot of the products that we've traded. So in a short period of time, good and bad, you've been able to witness something that I don't know if it's going to stay with us for a long time, but eventually we'll go away. So you're at an advantage and you're at a disadvantage because we didn't get a lot of the principles down of trading for you yet. So now we've got an account. Let's take a look at your account. It's down around $2,000, $2,100, and change it looks like. You are up about $800 today. You're only up around $600. I have to tell you, when I first started doing this with Katie, if we had a day where her account, using about the same amount of buying power, moves $50. The whole account, that was a kind of a wild day. I mean, that's how it was for the beginning of our show. Yes. Now what we are, we're in a position which is kind of a good position for those people who are starting to learn how to trade. We're kind of a little bit behind the eight ball. We're not playing from an offensive standpoint. We're kind of playing from a defensive standpoint right now. And by defense, I mean, you're looking at your deltas on your position. Let's beta weight your overall portfolio. So we're just going to click on beta weighting, put an SPY, and you're long about 20 deltas. If you remember the last time we did this, we were long about 150 deltas and about 100 deltas. Now, 2021 deltas. That's just how fast things are moving. My thought for you, when you take a look at this, you know, your biggest delta, your longest delta is there in SPY, 25 long delt, win, which has been a pig. Which has been a pig. And then everything else is pretty much flat, meaning your delta is pretty much flat. So where the market is today is probably, if we were closing here at expiration, a really good price for you. You had some oil-related products and stocks that you've been leaning a little bit long on that you got paid on today, which is nice. So if this was expiration, you'd probably have the majority of your money back. Maybe even be positive, but it's not expiration. Yeah, there's still time. There's still time premium left. So we've got to keep, since we have a portfolio after looking at it, beta weighted to SPY, that's basically neutral with a little bit of long delta, I wanted to come on the show when, before we started the show, the Dow was up around 300 points. It's only up 80 now. And the E-mini S&P's are up 10. They were up 40. I wanted to put on a skewed iron condor, meaning I wanted to sell the call spread a little bit closer than the put spread to give yourself a little bit of negative delta. Now what the market moving the way it is, I kind of want to change it up a little bit. So the only ETF that you don't have up there, equity related, you have a position SPY, you have a position in the queues, you have a position in IWM, the only one missing is the Dow, DIA. So I thought we would take a look at DIA. Let's go into the account state, the charts for a moment, and just take a look at the diamonds, DIA. And see if it fits our criteria. So you got an IV rank of around 63. Truth be told when I was looking at it earlier, it was around 54. So volatility is expanded. That's a good thing for us. It's back into the middle of the range of where it's been recently. You know, this is what I hate about charts and charting. And I only look at it as kind of like a point for you to take a look at. Now I'm watching the market all day long. I know you're doing support out there watching the market all day long with people too. But I know what do you say the ranges? This is a, I think it's a yearly chart or six month chart. What do you say the ranges in the diamonds for the IVR? No, I'm sorry, the stock price. I mean, based on what it's what I'm looking at, I would think you can't do. You can't, you can't base on anything else. 75 is where it was traditionally before the last week. OK, I mean, I would kind of disagree. I mean, the high is 180, the low is 150. Yeah, I mean, that's, that's all, that's all you can say, right? I mean, that's what I mean, that's what it is, right? So let's throw out the high and let's throw out the low. So let's say the low is 155, like throughout the low extreme. Yeah. And let's throw out the high extreme of 185 and say it's 180. So from 180 to 155 has been the range over the last six months. But it's spent five and a half months wrapped around 175, right? Yeah. I mean, that's what I was referring to. So you're right. So we can, because volatility is so high right now and because there's so much craziness in the market for lack of a better word, we can go so much wider than we were able to go before by selling strangles. Now they take a lot of buying power. So what I'd like to do is look at a strangle and then see if we can buy our wings to define our risk. Does that make sense? Yeah. OK, let's go into the trade page. We can just stay right here and toss is fine by me. And open up. Well, what month should we be in? We should be going to the October. That's correct. We're going closest to 45 days. So do we do. So do we do use the weeklies with 43 days? No. Right. I like, I like to stay in the monthly options, especially with a new trader. I'm looking for around 45 days closest to 45 days that brings me to October. We don't have to worry about earnings in an ETF. There are none. So perfect storm. Yeah. High implied volatility. Let's go in October. And let's open up a bunch of strikes. You're going to have to open up like 90. OK, so what do we like to do typically? Like to collect how much credit on a strangle? A third of the width of the. No, on a strangle on a strangle. Right. And they could call and they could put one, collect at least a dollar. So if you were looking at the put side, what put would you be looking to sell? If for a dollar or if we're going to do half and half, what we're going to do is what we're going to do is strangle. So it's half and half, right? Yeah. So we'd go at like the 130 or the 131. Sure. Any any of those from like let's just say 134 to 127 are actually fine. Actually, if you look on the right hand side there, that probability of being in them in the money that 5%. That's like a full standard deviation is 15%. 5% is almost like a two standard deviation move. So now what we couldn't get just a few weeks ago at 15% probability of being in the money, you can get at a 5% probability of being in the money just because volatility has expanded so much. That's correct. So let's just for argument six, you can see the markets are a little bit wide there. You notice from the 29 puts, the 28 puts, 27, but they're all around the same, right? Like same price. Yeah. Look at all the offers on them. They're pennies away. So you can have to do a little bit of price discovery. And when you're trading with one contract, it's going to make it a little bit harder. So you have to go higher on your price and then come down low. So let's just say for argument six, we split the difference and we go in it like the 128 put. Okay. Okay. So we're going to sell one make that one contract, please, and make sure you're in the right account too. Should be account that ends in 81. Okay. Let's go up to the calls. Okay, stop. What call are you going to sell? Yeah. You might have to go up a little bit between like 177 and yeah, right around 177 ish. You notice the probability of being in the money there. What is that? 9%. 9%. It's almost double. That's skew. Meaning you can't get as much for the call as you can for the put. There's more fear to the downside. So those puts are bit higher, even though they're further away from the market. Makes sense? Okay. Let's, since I wanted to skew it a little bit to the downside, give ourselves a little bit of downside delta, let's take that call from 176 ish to 173. Does that work for you? Yeah. Now why pick 173? I really should pick 174 because it's wrapped around that 15% probability of being in the money. Keepers put a circle around that says 1611. So that would keep us outside of a one standard deviation. Exactly. Or right around a one standard deviation move. That's correct. Okay. So we're going further on the put, closer on the call, give ourselves a little bit more short delta. Just hold down the control key and click on the 174. That's fine. Keep muscles really honest. Okay. Now let's go on the call side. Let's go all the way down to define our risk because hit confirm and send one time on that trade. You use about 2200 hours worth of buying power. Not bad. But the way my account is right now. You're using almost 20,000 of a 30,000 dollar account. I want to see if we can tighten that up a little bit. So let's close that. And let's keep in mind that it's 22 dollars or 22 hundred dollars. So let's go up to the calls and see which call can we buy for a nickel or something like that. Okay, stop. It looks like a 84. Yeah, 184, 185. Okay. Let's just go 185 because we're going to have to go further on the call side. So we're $11 right now. Okay. So for five cents, we've built a, we're starting to build an iron condor that's $11 wide. That's going to use $1100 worth of buying power. Actually, $1,000 worth of buying power because you're collecting almost a dollar or the lower a dollar. Yeah. Instead of 2200. So we're cutting in half and paying a nickel. But we got to do something on the put side too. So let's go to the put side. Let's see if we can go 11 points lower and see what happens with selling the 128 put. Let's go to the one 17 put. Now look at the market on the one 17 put. Look at the market on all of those puts. So the 20 put, the 19 put, the 18 put, the 17 put. They're all basically the same price. Yeah. Right. And what we selling the 128 put for? The 128 we're selling for $50. Like $0.50. So if we've got to buy the other one for $0.25. We're selling that wide put spread for 25 cents. It doesn't make much sense. That's awesome. And the fact that you can realize that is really amazing. So just sell the call spread. Okay. So I did. So then it'll be. So if you're looking for short delta, I want to do both sides. I either have to go closer with my iron condor. Or I have to just sell the call spread. So then that keeps us with risk to the downside then. Nope. That keeps us with risk only to the upside in this position. You're selling a call spread. You're going to put or just you can hit customizing change it to zero or whatever. Didn't stand. You're only selling a call spread. Okay. Did I lose you? A little bit. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, we'll talk about it. It's good. I'm going to have to show us over. Let's take a let's just think about what we talked about here today. What I wanted to go over was your whole portfolio. You're long about 20 delta. I wanted to find something that would give you about 20 delta's worth of 20 short delta's. You're long 20 delta's in your portfolio. The object is not to get your portfolio to delta neutral. But you have been riding these delta's up for the last couple of days. The markets accommodated you. Let's look to sell into strength. To neutralize your position a little bit by selling 20 to 50 delta's. If we sell an option that has a 15% probability of being in the money, it has about a 15 delta that would have gotten you just about neutral in your overall position. Cool. All right. Good job out of you. Who comes up next? Tonight. What do I normally say? What do I say?
