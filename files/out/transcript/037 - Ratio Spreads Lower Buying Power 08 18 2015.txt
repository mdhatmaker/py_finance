 I'm not sure if you're going to be able to do this. I think I'm going to be back. When do I start? That versus that? How are you? Good. Good day for me today. Good day for you today, yeah. It's been good. I got some movement in my direction for Netflix and TLT, which we were talking about yesterday. I'm with Incy, and what happens, and they're both moving in my direction, so I got a couple bucks back at the moment on those. It's nice to get something to go your direction from changing. You're allowed. Definitely. You're allowed. You're counted down around 200 bucks since we've started this, about $210. You're up about $127 today. You've gotten back about a third or a little bit more of all your total losses, which is cool. Again, the point of the show is to learn strategies, but also to make money, too. We don't do anything here. We don't want to make money on, so we want to get in the plus column. Very typical for new traders to do exactly how you did. You started out gang busters. Every trade you made was a winner. You were up like 200 bucks. Took a vacation for a week. Came back. Had a swing of about dynamic and trade for a week or so. Had a swing around $500. You were down around $300, $400 at one time. Now your count's starting to come back a little bit more. Number of occurrences keep moving on. You mentioned a couple of things to me at the lunch table today. What did you want to talk about? Well, because with the expiration this week, a lot of my coincidentally losers, but they're my shorter positions in Netflix and TLT, SPY. SPY. I think those are the only three that we have left in the front window. Everything else is September. Yes. But that's most of my short side of the portfolio. My September expiration is generally long. Long to neutral. Long to neutral. Yes. I was looking to get short. The marketer. Get short. Okay. Let me try to wrap it up here for a minute. Your overall portfolio is short about 40 delta. You want to put up the overall account so people can play along and look at the numbers at home too. So your overall account is short about 40 SPY beta weighted delta. Do we have it up there? Yeah, do them all. Where's your beta weighted delta on that? Do we have to go to the other view? My fault. What does it say? It's neutral. Almost at zero. Almost at zero. Yeah. Okay. When I beta weighted it earlier, it looked like it was around 50 delta. When I have it at about 50, I'm 50 short on the August. And then close to 50 long on the September. So basically even swing around. Okay. And what you're saying is with your short delta that you have going away in three days, you're worried about what's going to happen to your delta in the back month. I'll be long 50 delta at the end of this week. Okay. So you bring a great thing up. Okay. Let's just click on your SPY position. Since we just beta weighted everything to SPY. And one of the three positions you have on in the front month is SPY. Let's take a look at that. Now it's just a classic butterfly. We don't have any risk to this trade. The risk that we have left in this trade is how much trading for right now. We took a profit of around 40 cents on a broken wing butterfly. And that's all our risk that we have now. Okay. So the risk reward on this looks great. But that graph is a little bit deceiving. It's $100 at its biggest peak. It's trading for it looks like around, see if we're with the closing trade is about 50 cents it looks like. The spread's trading for around half of its possible profit. It's giving you some short deltas in the front month, which you will lose as soon as expiration goes off, which is in three days, or this position moves away. Makes sense? Okay. So why don't we close that position? Take the profit. It's win-win. Yeah. Great trade. And turn it into a different position in September that will give you some short deltas there. Cool. And we'll leave the Netflix trade on and we'll leave the TLT trade on. All right. So this one will be around $90 total. Profit on the overall trade that you put on that's correct. You made about 40 cents before and whatever this is trading for 50 cents or something like that, or pretty close to it. Oh, let's go into 50 cents and see what happens. We can always change it later on. Now you do want the stock to be at 209 at expiration. The stock is 209 81, but that's at Friday, not today. Yeah. Okay. So did we get filled on that? Did not get filled on that? Okay. So why don't we cancel and replace it and go down a penny and while he's doing that for us, what he's going to do is click on SPY, edit order, go down to 49 cents. We'll see if we get filled. And if we have to move it again, after the show is over, we'll move it again. Okay. Cool. I want to look at a ratio spread. Let's talk about your positions for a minute. Are they an alphabetical? Put them in alphabetical order for me. You can go to the option only view if you want. I'm sorry. The view all if you want. Okay. So in Apple, you have a strangle. I just want you to listen to what I say. Let's take a look at the results of strangle. CNX is a strangle. F-C-X is a strangle. MON is a strangle. NEM is a covered call, which is synthetic short put. I want to get into synthetics. Netflix is a synthetic. It's a butterfly, brokowing butterfly, but it's a synthetic short call spread. O-I-H is a strangle. The Q's you have an iron condor on. SPY you have a butterfly on that we're looking to close. TLT you have an iron condor on, which is really just a short call spread right now, because it's right at the money or just in the money. You're short the 121-124 with a stock at 123 and a half. And then in Twitter you have a short put, long position. You have a synthetic stock position, short two puts, short one call, and in win you have a strangle. So the word that popped out there a lot was a strangle. So I don't want to do anything that involves around a strangle. You're also using around $9,000 of a $30,000 portfolio. So I got to keep that in the back of my mind too. One third of your buying power is not a lot to be using, especially with IV rank being as low as it is, I think it's pretty active actually. If IV rank was high, I'd want you to be 50% closer to 80% on a $30,000 portfolio. So SPY is a big product. By big product I mean it's trading over $200, right? Yeah. So let's go into SPY. So a naked option in SPY would take around $4,000. Now of all the positions that you have on, you're only using $9,000. All of those strangles. You're only using $9,000 of your overall portfolio. So I want to keep things consistent. What I'd like to do when we're looking at a ratio spread is we like to keep a ratio spread is buying one selling two. A ratio spread can be any, it could be buying four selling five. It could be buying two selling three. We don't like to get any more than one by two. We will on occasion go one by three if volatility is really high, but we like one by two and we like to do it for a credit. We typically like to buy the option that's maybe one strike in the money, two strikes in the money, and sell an option that's one strike out of the money or two strikes out of the money. With that in mind, let's go into September and let's look at SPY 31 days to go. You can do a vertical spread and change it if you'd like. We're going to a long call and we'll actually go $3.00 is perfect. Move those strikes down so that my buy is in the money. $109. Change it. Make it $9.11. Make it $2 wide. Double click on the $11 call and make it two contracts. If I buy one of the $109 calls, I sell two of the $11 calls. I'm getting about a dollar in credit. Now that dollar is not as significant as when we look at a strangle and I tell you we like to collect a dollar, it just happens to be a coincidence here. I want to collect a credit because then I have no risk to one side. I have no risk to the downside. If I have no risk to the downside here, this has to benefit from a short movement or a down movement in the overall market, which is exactly what you are looking to do with your position. This is in September, which gives you some short deltas in September. This is a synthetic short call. That's what it works out to be. Now you break even on this, if you click on the little dollar amount, it's going to be just above your short strike plus the width of the strikes, meaning $109.11. That's $2, right? Plus the credit you received, it switched to $0.99. It was $1 before. It gives you a break even of $2.14. That break even of $2.14 has about a $67. That's just called it 70% probability of success. It also relies on volatility down ticking. Now, volatility is not high in SPY right now. It's 21%. But we're trying to get synthetic short deltas. We're trying to get short deltas in your overall portfolio. We're replacing one with the other. Let's go into a chart of SPY just quickly. Now I'm not going to make a great case here. I'm not going to argue, and you certainly could argue that the IV rank is not high enough in here. At a 20% implied volatility was actually a little bit higher before. At a 20% implied volatility, it's been as high as 60 over the last five months. I'm throwing out the first month there, and it's been as low as 0. It's still on the low end of the range, but I need short deltas. I need something. We're tweaking it a little bit. I'm buying a call spread, which is something you would do in a low implied volatility. I'm selling another call not to finance it because I need short deltas. Does that make sense? You certainly could just sell a call, but I don't think the IV rank warrants it. So we'll be close to 50 delta short on this, right? Because we're the two at the money calls. It'll be less. They're not at the money. Stocks 109. Sorry, 209, and you're selling the two at 11. Oh, 219, okay. So it only gives you about 10, 12 short deltas, not as much as you think. They will grow as the stock moves higher. What's the best price for this? Where do you want the stock to be at expiration? In between? No, I'll give you a hint. Typically all the strategies that we do, you want the stock to be right at your short strike. 211. Think about it. The 209 call, if this was expiration 31 days from now is going to be worth how much? It's going to have no extrinsic value. It's going to be parity. How much would it be worth? Nothing. No, the 209 call. Stocks at 211. If it goes to 211? Yes. It'd be worth $2. Exactly. You're selling this. What would the 211 calls be worth if the stock was 211? Nothing. Zero. So the one you own is worth $2. The calls you short are nothing. You got a dollar premium, and credit in this, you make $3 on a $2 move. Yeah, if it goes to 211, because then I can sell the long position for the $2. So it's a short position because you have no risk to the downside, but you really want 211. It's not an iron condo, but it's kind of like, you know, it's okay if it goes higher or just not too high. And you're breaking even all the way up to 214. Okay. That's going to use around $4,000 in buying power. That's too much buying power. Let's define our risk. But it's really not defining your risk. It's going to lower our buying power significantly. Now, you know, if you had a million dollar account, maybe you do this trade because $4,000 doesn't matter to you. If you did 10 contracts, $40,000 in buying power doesn't matter to you. But you can only control what you have, and that's how much money you have. So let's buy and add the money call. Let's look to buy like the 219 call. Make it like a broken-wing butterfly. Exactly. It's a broken-wing butterfly. I mean, like we start out, I just, so if you can break down all these positions, like we just started out as a ratio spread. You said, well, that makes it a broken-wing butterfly. Yeah, it does make it a broken-wing butterfly. Not in the classic sense, because it's $8 wide by $2 wide. But yes, it's a broken-wing butterfly. It doesn't change your probably success, you know, by more than a percentage point or two. It does take away some of your credit, but you get to save $3,500 in buying power to use some place else. And that's more important. That's a lot more powerful for increasing your return on capital by doing that. Let's put this in $0.87 is the mid price. Let's leave it there right at $0.88. It could firm and send it send. And when you get filled on one, we'll move the other one. If you don't get filled on the other one, we'll move them both. Make sense? Cool. Yeah. All right, let's just take a quick second here to recap on what we talked about. We talked about looking at your overall portfolio and where your deltas are. Meaning, are they in August or they September? We talked about it yesterday, how your short deltas mostly in August, your long adelta was mostly in September. So what we tried to do today with the ratio spread is take off some of that short delta in August and replace it with short delta in September. Okay? Yeah. Okay, cool. You all right? Yeah. All right, good for you. And you had a nice winner on a broker-wing butterfly of $90. Yeah. That's a lot. Yeah. On a small $2 wide, broker-wing butterfly. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. Normally say, peace. Peace.
