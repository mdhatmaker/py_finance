 I'm gonna go back to the next episode. I'm gonna go back to the next episode. I'm gonna go back to the next episode. Nicky we're back. Where do I start? Back to back. Back to back. How are you? Good. How was your night last night? Um, it was good. It was tough. I was bullish on and a stock that I was bearish on. Um, 15,000 stocks to choose from. We have software that uh, uh, basically does most of the work for you. I gave you the criteria and set up and you had a hard time finding a couple of stocks. I, it was. It was. I mean, their earnings time is coming up. So it was really hard for me to find one that didn't have earnings within the next 45 days. That was really the, the hardest thing to find. I, I mean, I was able to, to find those but something that didn't have any. Hi, I have high implied volatility rank that we always look for. Yeah. Good. So, um, especially one that I was. Had a bullish. Or a bearish idea on. I found one for uh, bullish. But, so you're a permable. I'm a permable. We're ass. Maybe we didn't know it, but we call this bad versus bad for other reasons, but maybe it's because I'm typically a perma bear Or at least when markets are at all time highs, which they are now I'm typically a lot more bearish than when markets are at Lows or have made a big move down than I kind of get bullish I kind of go both ways, but I'm really a perma bear more than anything else I love to sell if I've got my palms out and I'm selling is what I'm most comfortable, but you're thinking That you're a perma bull. How many trades have you made in your entire life? 0 This is how do you know what you are? I haven't picked a side yet. No, no, no, no, it's good. I don't want you to pick a side pick a side I mean truth be told Again on the show that we that we do all day for almost five hours a day Markets have been going up for the most part. So I'm a contrarian I like to sell when everybody wants to buy I like to buy when everybody else likes to sell So what I want to do here and throughout the show is I want to stay as Neutral as possible and make you grow to your own comfort just so that everybody out there can grow to their own comfort But you also have to have some sort of market assumptions. So to say that you're a bullish trader quote-unquote bulls trader or even a bearish trader is way too early when you haven't made a trade So you have no idea you have no idea what you are or what you're going to become or how you're going to like the trade You know everybody develops a different style Tom Saasoff and myself have worked together for you know almost 30 years doing the same type of business same type of trades We're typically on the same sides of the market But I might do a different strategy than he does I don't want to risk as much capital as he does I want to risk more capital he does I'd rather have a higher probability of success trade Then a 50 50 shot trade that he might put on so that's what happens in a civil partnership This is a lot of time. Yeah, if you watch our show it's not so it's not so civil sometimes But but yes, okay, so you had a homework assignment. I digress let you had a homework assignment We were looking for a bullish stock and a bearish stock What did you come up with and how did you come up with the process? So the stock that I chose to be bullish on was Boba okay, why and The reason I picked that was that I mean it's relatively short up of Boba if you don't mind that you don't have to it Nick let's have let's have the team do it for more good It's at a relative low point. I think it was about four or five dollars Above its lowest point that it was it's been at and You know, obviously it was one of those stocks that opened and and was kind of on fire when it when it came out and so This is a fifty this is a fifty two week chart above and again It's just for demonstration purposes. I don't look any technicals or if there's more green or more red or anything else like that I just look at it for price So I'm gonna look at it like a new trader like you so you said it's relatively at a low price what time frame did you look at? Well the 52 weeks. I mean, well, that's 52 weeks, but but how do you judge something as high low? So here's I'm saying Bob is not the greatest example But if you were to tell me you should say that Bob is at an all-time low Because for 52 weeks it really hasn't been any lower Yeah, so so it's not relatively low. It's at an all-time low But it only has four months worth of data if we were looking at another stock like Apple or something like that Put a baffle for a moment and again I just like to go to Apple because it's widely held and and and people Understand what the stock is either so here in Apple if I was to show you a 52 week graph of Apple you would say High-end low-end what which end high end okay now let's change that graph to a 30-day graph Okay, now is it at the high end or a low end? Low end okay, so how can a stock be at the high end of the low end my point that I'm making here just bear with me for a moment Because we're trying to learn and I love the pushback like I I think the audience wants you to push back And I want you to push back because this is the only way that you're going to be able to learn or at least not even learn That's a bad term. It's the only way that you're going to get to Formula your own opinion is if you have Something else to look at besides your own opinion because your own opinion is very Public and new you've never made your first trade so give me a benefit of the doubt for a moment and let's look here How can a stock be at the high end of its range and the low end of its range at the same time? This is why It's a question. This is why I hate to look at charts for anything other than Price and price for where something's been now for me Price change yeah like day today like you brought a Baba. I don't trade Baba a lot But it's been in the news so I kind of know where it's been and and where it's going that other stock that you mentioned yesterday P R a a if I didn't see a chart of PR a a I would have no idea where it's been or where it's going That doesn't where it's been and where it is that has that has no bearing on where it's going to go The only thing I can judge it by were the things that I gave you yesterday and we'll we'll recap them in a minute. Okay, so We just prove that that looking you know depends on what time frame you look at That gives you what what your opinion is on high end to low end so I got to throw that out like I can't use that Now we're gonna live in a 40 well what well you tell me I told you when we were gonna open a trade What was the what was the optimal time? Like how much time till expiration do we typically look at do you remember? Yeah, it was 40 to 45 days around 45 days Okay, so to give myself a little bit of room Three to six months. That's about as much time as I'm gonna look at it a stock. Does that does that make sense? If you're gonna look at a graph if I'm gonna look at a graph just to get a just to get a view So let's just let's just keep the 52 week the way we have it But really I'm only gonna look at the last six months or so and you've got Was it have it July August September that has that has all has a film that has a full year right? Is it a full year yeah 52 weeks okay, so I'm only gonna look at like the last half of the graph Does that make sense? So if I was looking if I was looking at Apple I would say to myself, you know what apples what in the last Six months the red box. I mean in the middle yeah, it's mid range. Yeah, okay So then I have to look at the applied volatility applied volatility is IV rank 51 yeah 51 up on top there you could put a circle around the few if you don't mind or arrows perfect All right 51% but we know that apple has earnings coming so apple gets thrown out can't make the trade We can even pull up the six month IVR that Doe uses as well you could on there I mean if sure is there a correlation there I mean if you're looking at six months worth of stock movement is a six month IVR something that you would It is and I have no problem using it as long as you do it all the time Okay, okay, so like like I have no problem with you looking at a one month IVR I don't think it's enough time, but as long as you use it all the time stay consistent then I'm okay with it I like 52 weeks some people argue that that six months is better It's all your personal preference make sense yeah, okay short a period of time gives you a little bit less of a it gives you more of a Like we just looked at a stock a moment ago from one year gave you a lot of data points on the chart Six months gave you a little bit less one one week a one month is gonna give you a lot less And I think six months is kind of like a happy medium So if you were doing like a longer term trade if you if you put on a trade that's let's say has 120 days or 110 days which you use stop What's your optimal time to put on a trade 40 to 45 days? Why are we gonna talk about something we're never gonna do? Make sense, mm-hmm, okay, so give me one of the stocks that you you said you couldn't find So I'm a little bit upset so I'd have to like remember yes that we talked about sitting you out of a football game How many games a year? Hold on, I said you know I did that well you graduated in four years So you must have done something well in college. Yeah, so We only played around ten football games a year eight to ten football games Something like that and you had to sit out one because you didn't do one of your homework assignments or get something done Right so the first day and you didn't do your homework 15,000 stocks I showed you exactly what okay? I couldn't find a stock stock I had an ETF that I that I okay, okay, well we'll live with that it's It's like doing your homework, but not really like halfway Like halfway you just like all right, so what so what were you bullish on? So I was bullish on I WM I WM you a bullish can I ask why it doesn't matter because there's no reason Same thing with taking a look at the chart and just deciding that you know It was that in the last year. It's at a high point and So you think it's gonna go higher? No to go bearish is go down. That was a bearish. Oh, it was your bearish play. I thought you said yeah He said bullish. I apologize. I mean was was Boba or your bullish was Boba and your bearish was I WM Yeah, you know what I don't mind it so much as because see I'm I'm a contrarian right so you got Boba on the low end You've got I WM on the high end for me that fits now that's not the reason why I would want you to make the trade or not But it fits my logic like to me. I'm selling something that's high I'm not selling the low and I'm buying something That's low and not buying the high. Yeah, most public does it exactly the opposite the same way that you walked into this room The insurance idea was that it's you know if you have a stock at a $100 you you know you want to buy that insurance so that if it goes down you hedge that loss 100% So my goal on the show was When we did when we did back to cool with Katie last person I did the show with we had somebody else doing most of the trades for us Meaning they would run that we call the driver make the trades my goal with you is I want to watch you as a as a new Trader stumble along on the platform make the mistakes so that you can learn how to use the platform really really well So you said and we're running out of time you said that you were long want to be long on Boba and short on I WM Okay, so tomorrow first thing soon as we get in here That's the trades that you're going to make and I'll show you how you're going to make them Let's let's try to let's try to wrap up everything that we that we just learned here or we have learned over the last couple of days And I've got another homework assignment for you All right, so the first thing that we were looking at we really didn't get to it was selling premium I want you to sell premium and if you're Bullish on Boba I want you to sell a put And if you're bearish on I WM I want you to sell a call the things that we look at are liquidity You certainly can go best back to best practices and that's your homework from 217 15 and everybody out there can do it and just watch that 15-minute segment on liquidity There are others and there might even be others that are better than that But at least you can find one you can understand a little bit more about liquidity and how you can find stocks instead of Stumbling on them no earnings was something that we looked at Did you look at when Boba had earnings? I didn't I mean I didn't see that it was I don't think it's within Fourteen days. We don't we don't think we know So you have to check if Boba has earnings does I WM have earnings? ETFs don't ETFs. I don't want to I'm not here. I'm not here to trick you ETFs don't have earnings So I WM SPY any ETF doesn't have earnings So you don't have to worry about that. So when earnings seasons coming along You might want to lean towards and look for trades in an ETF high IV rank Does Boba have a high IV rank? Yeah, okay, so you're good there But you got to check for earnings because I think earnings are coming up 45 days to open is a market measure from 117 14 and there are others that you can look at for our criteria and opening trades All right, tomorrow's Friday Let's get a trade done you're gonna make your first trade tomorrow for sure in those two stocks You're gonna be selling IWM you're gonna be buying Boba who comes up next Tim Knight What are we saying peace good job Nicky?
