 You Thinking we're back when I start bat versus bat. How are you good? I've I've I've I got some relief today on some of my positions which which was a good a good day for me then good good answer Yeah, you're about $108 in your account overall for the day. We were down about that yesterday. So, net it's basically a wash for the last couple of days. Had some big movement in the market today. I mean, probably the biggest movement you've seen in your trading career so far. For sure. For sure. One thing I want to talk about, let's put a chart up of Apple if you don't mind. Apple's had a lot of movement today. Stock traded under 110. That's under your short strike. We talked about it yesterday. How we would roll down the call if it breached our strike. It did the stock. It subsequently rallied back. And that's cost us about 60 bucks. But if you look at your Apple position right now, you're unchanged for the day. Now, you would have been up $60. Had we done nothing. Which is a substantial amount of money when you're down $115 or $120 on the overall trade. So, for this example, that roll down hurt us. Yet high implied volatility. You had extreme price movement. You've got to, you know, that's our rules. That's our guidelines to protect the position. Now we sit with it. Yeah. Makes sense? That's still in the middle of our strikes. You're short to $12115 call. And that's the only thing. No, 110. I'm sorry, one. $12110. $110 put. Yeah, that put. $110 put. $120 call with the stock at $115. OK. I don't want to talk too much about the trades you have on. I want to look at a new trade today. OK. And I want to look at, I want to talk a little bit about like a stock substitution. OK. So let's go to a city group for a minute. And let's go to a trade page. I go to chart. That's fine. I'm sorry. You can do it however you want to do it. OK. So, stock's down about 3% over the last 10 days. 10 trading days or so. I had a bigger movement earlier today when I was looking at this. So it's kind of come back a little bit. It's not going to hurt you so much on this trade. And I'll explain to you why. Ivey rank of 51%, relatively high. It's been as high as 80% back in March or something like that. But relatively high, especially shortly after earnings. Last time, it had earnings. Ivey rank never got above 25. OK. So we've got high implied volatility. And not really low price, but not really high price either. I mean, it's kind of in the middle of its most recent range. All right. So I'll think about putting on a neutral trade, but using less buying power. Let me try to explain. Let's go to a trade page on city group. So to buy 100 shares of city group, you'll need about $1,600 in buying power reduction for your account. That would be any type of margin account. Your account's no special than anybody else's that has a margin account. All right. So if I wanted to buy a covered call in here, which would be, well, what do you consider a covered call? Bullish, bearish, or neutral strategy? What it depends on what you're, if you're doing like a short covered call, would be a bullish strategy. There's only buying a covered call and selling a covered call. We buy covered calls to open, and then we would sell a covered call to close. We're never going to sell a covered call to open. Does that make sense? Yeah. Buy a covered call that means you're buying stock selling the call. It's just called a covered call. So is a bullish bearish or neutral? Well, it's a neutral position you want to stay in between. Covered call is buying stock, selling, and at the money, or just out of the money call. Typically, we sell the out of the money call, or the call with around 50 to 30 delta. So you have a small range below where the current stock price is, depending on how much credit you're getting for the call. Complicated too much. Bullish, bearish, or neutral strategy? Neutral to bullish? Perfect. I'm buying 100 shares of stock. That's 100 delta's. And I'm selling a call between 50 and 30 delta's. That's going to leave me anywhere between 50 and 70 long delta's. It's a bullish to neutral trade. If the stock doesn't move anywhere, I still make money, because the premium I sold on the call. But I really want the stock to fly. Yeah. We do that with new money. We do that with new money. We want the stock to go up into perpetuity, because we have a limited amount of profit we can make. We'd like to make it tomorrow. It should go to 100. Does it make sense? Yeah. OK. $1,600 to buy 100 shares of stock. About $1,500 in change to buy 100 shares of stock and sell the nearest out of the money call, which has about a $46 delta. If you can circle it for me, it's a $57.5 call. That would leave us long about 50 shares of stock. OK. My possible profit on the trade is the difference between the stock price, which let's just round it to $57. So I can buy the stock from $57. And it can go. I'm going to have to, somebody has the contract to buy it for me at $57.5. So I can make $50. I'm selling the call. Let's just round up to $1.40. So I can make about $190 on the trade. Does that make sense? Yeah. Total. Yes. And I'm using $1,600 worth of buying power. OK. What if we instead of buying stock did a little bit of a stock substitute? Can you see the delta on the 50 call? Well, it says 100 right now, but it really should be more like 90. But let's just circle it. OK. So the 50 call has 100 delta. I'm going to argue that that's a little bit off, because look at the put on the other side. It has a little bit of value. It also has a delta. It has to equal 100. So that call delta of around 90 gives me 90 shares of stock. For all intensive purposes, that's a stock substitute for me. It's going to move one to one with the stock. OK. Makes sense? Yeah, because you're close to one delta, which is 100 shares. OK. So if I wanted to buy that option, I'd have to pay somewhere around parity for it. Do you know what parity is on that option? With the stock trading, let's just call it $57. It would be $7. Exactly. Perfect. So I could buy that call for $7 if somebody was willing to sell it to me at parity. And I would have the same equivalent as buying 100 shares of stock. So instead of using 1,600 bucks, I'm only using $700. I could sell that same out of the money call, $57.5 call, for $1.40. I'd only be buying a call spread. My risk would only be what I paid, $7, minus the $1.40, or around $5.60. So I turned $1600 worth of buying power into $5.60. Does that make sense so far? Because if you're taking the $1.40 off the top. Typical vertical spread, but like stock substitute, because you're so deep in the money. Does that make sense? Yeah. OK. Your break even would be around $65.40. The difference between the price that you're paying for the spread and where the stock is. Does that make sense? Yeah. OK. So so far we're good. You've done this before. And OK. Nobody's going to sell us that call at $7. They probably want more. Why? Because if it's only worth $7, why wouldn't someone sell to me at $701 or $702 or $704? I mean, if you're lucky, but there's probably more extrinsic value than that's just at $7. Because there's time. Exactly. The put is worth something. So for me to get 100 delta's, I'd have to buy the call and sell the put. Does that make sense? Yeah. Because you're the 8 delta's there. And then so I could buy that call if I could for a parry would be around $7. And yeah, I call it about $0.20 or something like that. Maybe a little bit less. OK. Does that make sense? And then you get another $0.20 for the put side. Well, I'm not going to do anything because I want it. I want to buy just that call. And I'm going to give up that $0.20 or that $0.23 or that $0.22 to somebody else who's going to sell me that call and then go and sell that put. So they do whatever they want with it. Does that make sense? Yeah. I mean, dilution? Yeah, I'm a little lost. Well, nobody's going to sell to you at parry, right? Yeah, because it's a scratch. I mean, no. No, they have risk. Yeah, they. So then not to have risk, they have to see if I, they sell you the call, they're now short 90 shares of stock. They have some risk. A lot of risk. Yeah, they have 10 shares of risk. Exactly. So they've got to do something against that. The way that they could cleanly do it would be to do something with that put. They would have to buy that put. They'd have to buy that put for $0.20, $0.21 or $0.22. So they'd be locking in a $0.20 loss. Does that make sense? Yeah. So instead of doing that, they'd be willing to sell you that option, probably $0.7.20. Yeah. So as opposed to having to sell that put. Excellent. That's correct. So now they're long, the free put. OK. That's trading at around $0.21. OK. OK, I'm just trying to get you ahead on how to price an option. Because look at the market on that. $6.50, $0.30. It's wide. Makes sense? Yeah. OK. So what if we bought one call and the 50 call and sold two of the 57 and a half calls? What would our delta position be then? Almost at 0. I mean, it would be yes, exactly. I mean, it would show 1, 2, or 5, delta's or something. We're getting 46 there. And then the 190 something on the long option so that it's canceling them out. Exactly. So on the covered call, let's back check. I'm trying to show you all the differences and the difference between all the different trades. OK. On the covered call, we had risk below our short price, the price we paid for it, which was around $55 and change on the stock. About $2 lower than we're at trading right now. OK. Not bad, but we have risk all the way to 0. Here, we have the same risk all the way to 0, but we're only paying $4 and 15 cents, which means our break even is $54, 15. OK. Does that make sense so far? Yeah, because we're taking the premium, the difference in the amount of premium, for the same buying power of a covered call. So what's the give up? The give up is I now have risk to the upside. Let's look at this on the other view. Reveals. Our risk to the upside should be $60, $60 and $60 or something like that. OK. $60, $60, $80, $3. $60, $3. It depends on where the stock is and then what you pay for it. OK. So the covered call only has risk. It's a bullish to neutral position. And it has risk only to one side, the downside. Here you have risk on two sides, but you're getting almost a third more in premium. Instead of $2 worth of premium, you're getting almost $3 worth of premium. OK. For the same buying power. Yeah. All you're doing is just cutting off your upside. Well, you have risk to the upside. You have a limited risk to the downside, because your call can only go to 0. You paid $4 and 15 cents for the whole thing. So you have $400 worth of risk to the downside. On the covered call, you have unlimited risk to the downside. Here you have unlimited risk to the upside. OK. So what kind of trade is this? It's a neutral strategy. Neutral strategy with upside risk. Makes sense? That's the trade that I want you to make. Cool. OK? Yep. All right. Let's take a quick review, because we ran out of time. So what do we look at today? We looked at buying it in the money call option as like a stock substitute to use less buying power. We looked at just a vertical spread that would define our risk as a covered call wood, define our profit as a covered call wood, but also define our risk. We'd have no risk to the downside on the vertical spread. Then we turned that vertical spread into a ratio spread one by two, but more as a stock substitution. So we're leaning neutral to slightly bullish, but we don't want it to go above its old high of around $60. Staying the same range, which is most of our positions. We want the stock to stay inside its range. Makes sense? Yeah. OK, cool. And you get a third more premium for the trade. All right. Awesome. Who comes up next? Tonight. What do I normally say? Peace. Peace. No.
