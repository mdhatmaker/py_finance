 I Make you a finally back where do I start that versus bat look we're the same color now. Oh come on I think I got you now a little bit Pretty close pretty close if a nice vacation. I did what's the vacation feel like? Um, it was great. I mean great great. Hold on a second. It was great. It's great. Your vacation was great It's up first let's take a look at your account for me My account was not great. That was not great. Everything I do revolves around how may account it Let's take a look at your account how do you account do this last week? Not good. It was better today, but It's better today today you're up around 350 bucks, but you lost about 450 $500 total on your overall account you went from up around a hundred dollars 50 bucks to 100 bucks depending on how things were marked and now you're down 50 dollars today But you but today's P&L is nice it up 350 bucks. Yeah, it's it's net your down 50 dollars on everything that you close Everything else. Yeah, alright, so I want to do like some portfolio review on because that's how we left Last week when when you left going over everything saying hey, you know We like everything that we saw let's go over what we still have and see if our opinion hasn't changed on that Okay, let's just click on Apple So Apple you have basically a strangle with the stock right at 120 Right in between it's right in between so that's what you want right so you don't see that's an easy decision to make Yeah, right because Apple's rally four dollars today And you actually have a profit in there of around $65 on the overall trade that you put in so you're gonna close that actually Pretty soon you want to make about 50% of your possible profit. Let's get out of that next one CNX Okay, um, it's one of my dogs. It's one of your dogs you're down about a hundred dollars on the trade So I was almost gonna say like a silly $15 stock, but as you can see any stock whether it's a you know a hundred dollar stock hundred and twenty dollar stock like Apple or a fifteen dollar stock like CNX they all these options can grow teeth Yeah, so you have to be careful them. Okay, so What do you want to do here? So you long about 60 shares of stock at 60 delta's 58 dollars 58 delta's you know when I looked at it It still got a really high IVR and it you know the one thing that I was thinking was like is there anything That we can continue you know sell in there to kind of Help the position at all. Okay, so so what you're saying is and you're on sorry Did you we don't talk about this ahead of time? So did you come up with this yourself you talk to the team? What did you I mean? I was just kind of playing around honestly. I was using the great. I want you always to be honest with me on this Yeah, no, no, I don't ever I don't ever want you to have to say again to be honest with you because that implies that you're not being honest other times So I want you to be honest with me forever on this show always okay But I was looking at like Selling if we could sell a call and add you know more premium You know call is is the opposite way and they would create a strangle. It's still be outside my You know my my two strikes, but you know, I was collecting a little bit a premium there then if it goes up a little bit you know Stop stop stop. I like exactly what you're saying don't don't put yourself in a wormhole So what you're saying is I have 60 shares of directional risk 57 and change Okay, you know you have one contract so it sounds small if it was 10 contracts it'd be 570 same kind of risk You know your account would probably be larger, but it's the same proportional risk So 57 shares might sound like small 570 might sound like a lot. They're basically the same thing Mm-hmm. Okay, so so you're saying is I'd rather get rid of some of that directional risk and add a little premium because C and X still has a high IV rank yes, I like it. Let's go into let's go to the trade page and go to CNX You've got a 92% IV rank totally fits you're lucky that you still have 39 days left to September So you're kind of in that same type of time frame that we would open a trade so you have a lot more For lack of a better word you have a lot more options to do like you have a lot more things to do if this was 11 days to go It's like it's closer role, you know like you can't sell anything because you know the option to be trading for 20 cents 10 cents or We're nothing even make sense. Yeah, okay, so let's look at what we can do So the first thing I would look to do is well what's the first thing you would look to like what's called you want to do? What kind of strategy would I want to do well you said you want to sell a call against it, right? I was looking to sell call cuz I you know What strike The one I was looking at was like the 17 I think there wasn't a lot of liquidity here. So in like the same The liquidity is there the markets only three four cents wide the liquidity is there It's 33 cents for the 17 So that I mean that you're not using any more buying power yeah, okay? So it just it just is is that acceptable number for you Well, let's move what are we at it? So you're okay, that's good. That's perfect just to compare So 76% Well the delta here I can do it here hold on one second. So what I want to look at is like what's the delta on that option? So the delta on the 16 option is 30 I'm just rounding you had 60 you'd be cutting your delta in half We like to cut out delta by one third to one half Okay, so that's in that I mean that would fit the only thing that I would say to you at this point with 39 days to go and you Certainly could is if you go below 15 you start getting inverted Meaning that your put is gonna be In the money and your call is gonna start to be in the money if the stock were to rally So with 39 days to go I would love for you to be above 15 So if you were to tell me any option above 15 I'd be happy with it the 15 call has a 40 delta You had about 57 delta so you'd be taking on a little bit more than 50% about 70% of your delta. What do you want to do? Well if I take on more that premium with the with the 16 Wouldn't that give me more opportunity like if you know, let's say that if cnx goes up by 10 or 15 cents tomorrow 10 or 15 cents not gonna make a difference gonna be a perfect play Yeah, wouldn't I be able to like kind of almost scratch out of it? With you play for scratch No, but I mean it's delta risk I love I love what you're working through it. It's delta risk versus premium received But let's think about what we would what happens if we add this trade. There's no extra buying power We're getting rid of some delta risk. So if you don't like the delta risk in cnx 60 delta You can reduce it by about two thirds 42 delta's 40 delta's minus the 60 delta's that you have about a little more than half that's the that's the play It's the 16 or the 17 call Personally, I like the 16 call just for the 50 cents versus the 30 cents Okay, let's do that then let's go So let's go in the bit is 53 the offers 57. Let's go in at 56 and see what happens. Okay, you can always change it later on Okay So now all around the world your tiny little one lot the smallest you can get is gonna change the market For all eternity gonna make this market 53 56 that's your offer No, that's really that's your offer now like you're you're changing Wall Street with your option your trade It's pretty impressive. Let's go back to your trade page running out of time ready. Okay, GLD That one's finally moved into into your range. Yeah, it's my right. So you don't think there's anything to do. No sounds good to me any That one was in my range too, but it's The price I got it. I was like 1760 something so because it's a covered call. It's a cover call Right that's showing there on Doza covered call with the stock. Yeah, so you're down about 20 bucks on this trade Yeah, so we'll sit okay, okay, let's go in the Netflix Netflix we've moved outside your range you're down around 150 or 160 bucks on the trade defined risk trade You want the stock to go down about four five dollars? Mm-hmm. I don't know. I think you sit. Yeah, so sound good to you Yeah, I mean this is close right and I don't want to close it for a loss So we'll say you only have 11 days left to that Netflix trades Okay, SPY that's your short delta trade This is the probably the only one that in hindsight which is such a terrible word You could have closed because this is a bearish position. Yeah, you are up around $70 on the trade half would have been about a hundred bucks So you can't kill yourself about that. I mean you might not have kept the other positions you had on if you didn't have this one on That makes sense. Mm-hmm. Let's get out of SPY TLT dog dog Okay, so your your your put spread is basically worthless, right? I mean it's two cents That was the one I wanted to put on originally you want to sell put spread correct you down about $70 on the iron condor Yeah, what can you do if anything here? Well, it's to find risk so we're not so you don't have to do anything. Yeah, mm-hmm May I guess you could Get rid of the the puts I mean like so so that's our worthless So you could buy back you could buy back your naked put and that wouldn't free up any buying power because you're not You don't get relief you have relief on both sides So so you only getting you only have margin on one side So you would be you'd still have one side on okay? So you take off the put for two cents pay no commission for that because if you just put the naked option for under a nickel There's no commission so that's something you could do But then that just leaves you with a call spread that's right at the money what you could do is you could roll the call spread To the following month September and if you could do that for even or a small credit That might be something you'd want to do Okay, so all you're doing is this extending duration Okay, so giving a chance to go Give a chance for TLT below that's correct. Yeah, a little bit of credit It kind of gives us a little more wiggle room exactly not a lot of wiggle room But a little bit but it extends duration by 39 days because this is gonna be over in 11 days So let's when we're done when you're done with the show Let's look to roll the call spread just the call side and close the naked put okay? If you can't roll for a credit just leave it alone or even you're probably gonna have to probably probably a small debit Anyway, we'll take a new trade for you because you need new trades. We were behind. Let's go to win WH Sorry WYNN and I'm just gonna make it really simple because or really fast because we'll have about two minutes I don't want to eat Tim's time 57% IV rank In our range in our IV rank range 39 days to go to expiration still good. Let's just do a strangle a real wide one Let's go to strangle strangle seem to be a We've had a strangle market. I mean he hasn't really gone anywhere. So 120 90 is a one standard deviation Fine with this you can also with the stock at around a hundred so you're you're $20 if you have 17 Excuse me 16 dollars away to the upside and you're only 14 Dollars away for the downside pretty much straight on you can go down to 85 go down to 85 just see what happens You're in the weekly options go to please go to 39 days. Thank you Okay, so your dollar 76 let's go down to the 80 85s Are you at a buck 30 what do we like to get on a strangle at least a dollar okay? So it's your decision 120 call 85 put or 120 call 90 put you do it when the show's over Okay, all right, let's take a quick moment here just to recap what we talked about and really all that we Talked about today was recapping going over your portfolio if you've been away from your portfolio for a week Go through everything. Did you like the pressure that you had on meaning did you did you Did your portfolio do well through the market if it didn't maybe you take away some of those deltas which you didn't see an X Did you like an iron kind of the add on a teal tea maybe not maybe we a role to extend some duration Makes sense. Yeah, all right good job at you today and welcome home and your account likes you being home too I know it's good to be back. That was the first thing I told you I was like I missed this who comes up next Tim night peace
