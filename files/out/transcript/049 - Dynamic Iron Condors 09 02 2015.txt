 What do I start? Bat vs. bat. How are you? Good. About 600 bucks. I'm OK. It's been a good day for me. Better. Better day. Yes. Listen, you had to mark it down significantly yesterday twice as much or more than it is today that it's up and your account's doing better today than yesterday. That's nice. I'll tell you what's coming out. That's the difference. OK. Let's, I got a couple things I want to talk about. We did earlier on the show, we did a dynamic iron condor, which is a little bit different than what we've normally done. So I'd like to do one of those with you. I might even want to try to do it in the diamonds if we could. I know you mentioned the diamonds yesterday. I had mentioned diamonds a few days before that. We don't have a diamond position. It's the one we haven't been in yet. And we haven't been in yet. There aren't quite as liquid as PY and IWM, but as markets get a little bit slower, they get a little bit tighter. I think we can do something in their day. So I wanted to do that. I also wanted to look if you could put up as account for me, that'd be great. You just go to toss, it'd be fine. I also wanted to look at your wind trade, stocks down $35 since we put on this trade, you're down $1,000 total on it. I wanted to show you how we can roll down one more time and kind of like, and kind of be like giving up. It's my way of getting out of the trade and taking the loss. Still keeping a trade on, still keeping the risk. I wanted to do that. And then possibly discuss why open up the field orders. In SPY, we roll down our naked call against the one by two put spread that we have on. So I think just for ease of doing things, I think if we do the dynamic iron condor first, I think it's pretty self explanatory, we can get to that, we can even do that in Doh if you want to. And then we can go to the stuff that's a little bit more complicated. Is that cool? Is that cool? Okay, all right, let's do that. Let's go to Doh for a quick second and let's just put in DIA. Just for the sake of time, the diamonds have had the highest IV rank of all of the ETFs, not by a lot, by a little just about four or five percentage points, that also could just be because the markets are a little bit wider in there too. So it's as wide as everything else or as liquid and as strong as everything else, deep and liquid meaning the markets are. IV rank of 59 has been coming down from around 60 to 70, it's down to 59 now. Dynamic iron condor is the short strikes, both at a 20% probability of being in the money and your long strikes that define your risk are at a 10%. Okay. So it's as simple as that. However the volatility skew is, if there's more skew in the puts, then your puts bread would be wider or tighter, do you think? If there's more, it'd be wider. You'd have to make it wider to get that credit, that credit, right? No, it just has to do with how, since the expectation of a move is so much greater to the downside, then that 10% probability is going to be further away. Let's do it and let's take a look. Okay. It might be easy if we just go to the table view and let's go to October. And we just stay in the monthly options, we don't trade the weekly options, we'll use delta here, delta probability being in the money is pretty much the same. You can stop right there for a moment. Do you see on the right hand side there on the put side, what put has about a 20 delta? Looking at 149. 148, either one of them, 1918, let's just go to the 148 for right now. Okay. Okay, let's click on selling the 148 and which one has a 10 delta of around? The 141. The 138. Yeah, 138, 137. All right there. Let's just go to the 138 and I'm skewing it a little bit just because probably even the money is going to be a little bit higher than the delta because probably even the money factors in the option being worth at least a penny. Okay. And on toss you'll see that these numbers kind of match up pretty close to what I'm talking about. 20% probably being the money, 10%. All right, let's look at the call side. The call side, we're looking at around what strike for that 20 delta? Between, I mean 71, 72. Let's go to 71, you're perfectly right. Sell the 71. And for the 10%. We're going to go to the 175. Exactly, let's go to 175. So you're looking at a $4 wide call spread. You see that, 171, 174 versus a 138, 148. It's $10 wide. It's $10 wide, so it's twice as wide on the downside than it is on the upside. But yet, both of them, both short options, which is your biggest concern, have a 20% probability of being in the money. That's skew. Okay. That's nice. This is trading for, it looks like about $1.79 that's been the mid price pretty much all day. You can notice the market's a little bit wide in there. 171, 187, 171 being the natural bid. 189 or so being the natural. So it's going to $1.80 and let's move it down as much as two to three cents and no more. Okay. After the show is over, just so we can do the rest of the show. We're going at 180 and see what happens. Okay. Okay. If I'll tell you the upticks a little bit or the market rally is a little bit, maybe you get filled. All right. Okay. Just outside our one third, the width. Idea. Different. Yes. Because it's not equal. It's not equal with on both sides, $3, $3. We collect $1, $1.13. Does it call the dynamic iron condor? Well, something different. Okay. Do you look for like a specific percentage of credit to get on these? Like is it compared to the, to the biggest side or the smallest side of the lake? It's really wrapped around Dave's tolle exploration, which is right around 45, which is the perfect time. Okay. All right. Yeah. Okay. Cool. So we hopefully will have another trade on. We'll put on the diamonds. Okay. So we'll go to the account statement tab if you wouldn't mind. And put in a win, please, W-Y-N-N. Pig. Pig, right. We started on 810 when the stock was trading at around 105. 105. It's exactly right. The stock is $72 or just under $71.81. I bought it there. I'd be down a lot more. Yeah. Well, so you got to think about that. I don't know if you're going to have a financial position, but there's somebody that bought it. There's somebody that sold it. There's somebody that's bought it and sold it for a loss. There's somebody that sold it and bought it for a profit or a scratch or everything's in between there. But what I want to show you is how we can kind of limit the loss that we have. Remember, how is short put was 90? All things being equal with the stock at, you know, 80. We've had a really fight. Remember the stock was 105. Yeah. Okay. When we get out of this trade, go to the trade page for a moment. How can we get out of this trade but without getting out of it? I want to get out at a better price. You're down about $1,000 on this trade. Let's see how we can get out at a better price. Now, what I should have showed you a moment ago, all of those roll downs, the mechanical rolling of the untested side, has brought in a credit of around $9.23, $0.25, something like that. It's called $9.25. If we roll down a little bit further and go what we call inverted, meaning our call is going to be in the money and our put is already in the money. If the stock lands in between there, somebody is going to put stock to us and we're going to sell stock to somebody else at expiration, we would have nothing. If both strikes are in the money, do you got me so far? Yeah. Okay. One's going to give me a hundred long dollars. That's where we've been at, though. We've reverted now when it changed return on capital to positions. You're inverted, but you're not, you're not, both strikes are not in the money. Stop right there. You're 78 call, although it is below your 90 put, your 90 put is in the money. You're still out of the money. So just here to where the stock is right now. Exactly. So if the stock were to expire here, you would come in long 100 shares of stock and you'd have to do something. In October, you could sell a call. I mean, there's a million things you can do about it where you can roll it. Today, a million things you can do about it. One's been kind of a, you know, the used to be a stock called was still around. Shield, Sears, SHLD. I can never make money of it. I just could, it was just, it had my number. You know, it was like, it was like when I was a kid, Mitchell and Cavaya could beat me up. He always beat me up. Nothing I do. Now Vivian, my next or neighbor, used to go and beat up Mitchell for me, but I couldn't beat up Mitchell. He even just had my number. I have nothing I could do about it. Same thing here. The win has just gotten that number. It's not really the most liquid stock and I don't want to go into it into perpetuity. And I was looking at the puts today even to roll them and it was like, if I wanted to roll down, this roll to the next, to the next expiration was like an 87 cent credit. It would give me years to get, to get to even on that. Or price movement. One day, yeah, or huge price movement. One day this stock is going to be up $10. We probably won't have a position. I want to add, but one day this actually would be up $10. So what I was suggesting that we do is we roll down to the 70, 78 call spread. So we sell the 70 call and we buy the 78 call. So we're selling out a new call, buying our 78 call back, not using any more buying power. It looks like it's only around $3.29 earlier today. It was around $3.40 when the stock was a little bit higher. Let's go in at $3.35. And maybe if the market continues to rally and this rally is a little bit, you can always move it down a little bit more. We'd have a total credit of around $12.50. And let's call it. And you would have a $20 inverted spread. 70 to 90 is $20. You collected $12.50. So it's an 800 loss. $750. You're down a thousand. You pick up, you don't pick up $250. You get $250 back. As opposed to just closing the position today. I mean, could the stock go below 70? Absolutely. Do you still have risk for the next two weeks? Absolutely. But for that risk, you've got a possible profit, possibly getting back $250. And it wouldn't even matter how far up the stock goes. That has to stay in between 70 and 90. Yeah, but if it's 71 or 89, it's not not a loss. That's going to be $800. That's correct. Or the $750. That's correct. It's tough. Pilled the swallow. Tough Pilled the swallow. You were down around $1400. You're down a thousand. You give up the directional risk. You know, if the stock were rally back to 78, you know, you could almost be breaking even on this trade. If I didn't make this move. That's correct. Let's beta weight your overall position. And we ran out of time and I didn't even get to what I really wanted to get to. Let's beta weight. Let's go to his monitor tip. You could send it. Do you want to send that? Go into 340. And so to give you some time to think about it. Yeah. Okay. Hey, confirm and send it. It's entirely up to you. I want it to be your trade. Cool. Let's go to the account statement tip for a moment. Beta weight is overall position to SPY. And we did roll down a little bit in SPY. So that took off the 28 long deltas that you have in SPY. They were around 45. Rolling down into strength. And then we can go over the one by two what it looks like. You have 38 long deltas. We really should be have short delta in this portfolio because you have positive theta. So we still got things to do. If you roll down your win, you'll pick up another 20 short deltas. That'll help you a little bit. All right. One last thing and it was everything that I wanted to talk about today. Let's go to his account statement tab. He put in SPY. You did a trade in October, just an October trade just a few days ago that I earned conduits. You see that 827 there? A $2.25 St. Credit. It's trading for around $1.60. We've done a market measure and a research about should I stay or should I go is what it's called. And it explains on a strangle how much percentage you should make and whether you should close a trade or keep the trade because everybody always asks I know how to get into a trade. How do I get out of a trade? This is not a strangle. It's an iron condor but it was very, very wide. $10 wide, very, very far out of the money. It's trading for around $1.60. You're up a little over 30%. After five days. After five days, five, six days. That's something that you would consider getting out of it. It's a bell. It was a strangle. I would tell you to get out of it. This is a synthetic strangle. I think you might consider taking a profit. I see diminishing return on capital at this point. When you hit 30% in five days. You got to profit. Maybe it's time to take it. Let's just go back and see what we discussed. We discussed a lot today. I really wanted to talk more about what I just touched on a moment ago and that's when to close a strangle. We did an excellent market measure. I hope they put up the slide if they could. There it is right there. Should I stay or should I go from July 30th, 2014, which explains, you should watch it in its entirety. You should watch it too. It's a market measure just telling you when you should get out of strangles, what percentage of profits compared to the days that it's held. You'll notice six days. You've got around a 25%, 28%. I can't remember exactly what your profit is. By this measure, you probably should take off that trade. We also talked about our SPY trade and we looked at the dynamic iron condor. A lot of stuff we did today. I hope you go back and watch that last market measure that we did and I enjoyed your company today. That was great. Who comes up next? Hi, Bees reporting.
