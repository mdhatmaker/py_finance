 Thank you. Nicky, where do I start? That versus bat. How are you son? Doing well. I'm doing well. We'll get to my trade, but I've got a little bone to pick with you today. Oh, okay. Go ahead. You know, earlier today, they were talking about Mike's new show, Mike and his white board. That's correct. I was telling you this early this morning. I had a Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Okay. 15 to 330. Okay. But Tom made a Slile over mark. He was like, you know, maybe we'll slide it in there and take the bat versus bat time slot and you're pretty quiet there. You're nothing, nothing. I sat there like a subordinate. Yeah, you don't consider that going against the family or what it is. Sometimes you got to keep your friends close and your enemies closer. So we just let Tom talk and everything. Something is all going to be ours, son. Don't worry about it. There's a revolution going on out there and he doesn't see it. Okay. All right. So listen, you wanted to make a new trade today. I want to review a trade that you put on yesterday and took off today. Let's try to do both and let's try to do them in a quick fashion. Okay. All right. Let's go. Let's just use the other platform and let's put up, let's put up dough for a moment. Let's use that screen for a second. All right. Let's go to tiles like we always go. The grid. You mentioned to me, we've already set up the same way. We found FCX. All we did was we went to the, like we do every day. I find this is that every day I look to find a trade. The first place I go, the first place I go is right here. And then I click on the funnel and I change it to the, to what I want. We're going to stay in the front month in August. So I have 24 days to, to exclude all the earnings. Have the earnings excluded. That would be the little arrow, the little blue circle up on top there. That's, yeah, perfect. And then I go from IV rank of 50 to 100. Okay. Spits out a list for me. You liked, you picked not me, which stuck? I was looking at Monsand. It was actually down, I mean, like it's been up and down all day today, but it was down like seven cents from the open price. You know, when I was looking at it, it moved up a little bit. But you know, it's one of those that are on an opt tickets relatively low in terms of, it's position in the, you know, over on the last 52 weeks, it's close to all time low. In the last 30 days, it's kind of gone from, you know, 105 to 110 down to, to 100. 105 to 110. Go to 105, the 110 to 100. You know, it's kind of been back and forth. So it's like right in the middle of that range now. And so I figured we would make a plan it. Okay. I didn't understand everything that you said there. For the reasons why I did it, I wish you would have said, high IV rank 80%. Well, that's always, that's what we're looking for. That's what we're filtering out is high IV ranks, no earnings. But all that other crap you spewed means nothing. I mean, it really means nothing because, because you have no idea where it's going to go. Any more than I have any idea where it's going to go, but you got a high implied IV rank 80%. What strategies can you use? I want to know. This is, hold on, this is important. Not, went down to, you said it's seven cents. It's actually been below $100 today. It's had a $1.5 move or something like that today. So all that other stuff, all color. That's old. No, no, I mean, I'm trying to be honest. I'm trying to be funny, but those are the things that I'm looking at it in deciding on why I want to pick this. I know, of course, IVR, all those things. I only have 30 years of doing this. Here, you do it. You show, you show us. What do you, shouldn't you have at least some kind of opinion? No, I'll give you your opinion. No, I don't mean your opinion. Mechanics? Yes. I agree. I mean, what about other stuff that you did? That's just bullshit. No, no, I'm being serious with you. Like, that's just like saying, you know, China's down 4% last night. What do you think the market was going to do today? I would have probably said lower. I think 90% of the people are the majority of the people who have said probably, market was going last time China was down 4% we went lower. Why would we go? It's all bull crap. What you have to do is find the right strategy to fit what's going on with the stock that you want to trade. You have Monsanto. It's down. Let's take a look. It's down about seven. Let's go to a chart on toss for a quick second. So it's down about 6%. I was going to say 7%. It's down 6% over the last 10 days. It definitely has a high implied volatility rank of 80%. What kind of strategy can you use in the stock? That's the mechanics. So what are you going to do? I want to sell and I want to sell. You want to sell premium. Yeah. So when you say sell, that means you want to get bearish on the stock. You want to sell some sort of premium on the stock. Yeah. Okay. I was thinking a strangle on it to sell both the put and the call. Perfect. Okay. So you want to go to the curve view of the table view. It doesn't matter to me. I usually like to start at the curve view. All right. Let's go to the curve. We're going to stay in August. Okay. A classic strangle. What delta are you looking to sell? I don't know. On each side. I believe I told you this with the maybe I didn't. I don't think so. I probably didn't. Okay. I mean, so I'll give it to you. A classic strangle that we want to sell typically one standard deviation. So go back to the strategies for a minute. And you got to get a September where you can change the settings in a minute. Go to strangle, open up the advanced settings. Use that expiration to 24. You can just click on one standard deviation if you want and click on go. Okay. So it brings up the 95 put and the 109 call that's with 24 days to go in August. Just as a guide, we want to collect at least the dollar. How much are we collecting here? 104. 104 is the mid price. It looks like it's about a 4 cent wide market. One dollar bit is the natural bid. 108 is the natural offer. Mid price of 104 typically gets filled around 50% of time. So you might have to move it a penny up or down depending on whether you're buying or selling it. We like to collect the dollar and we like to collect the dollar when there's at least 45 days to expiration. Now there's 24 days to expiration. So the one standard deviation, those two white lines are going to be a little tighter than if it was 54 days to go. If you look at September, September standard deviation is going to be wider out. Does that make sense? There's more days. There's more time. There's more time to it. So this is a perfect fit for the strategy that you want to do. Now this is not skewed in any way. The stock is basically in the middle. The stock is 101. The put is 95. So how many strikes away? Six strikes away. And then it's eight to the... I guess seven. Seven. You round it to 102 because it's the 67. Seven and change. So you can say you have a little bit more room to the upside than you do on the downside. Does that make sense? Yeah. That's a classic strangle, a classic price that we like to get. You're going to use about $1300 in buying power going out that wide in this stock. Okay. I'm coming back. So I love it. I think that's a good play. All the other stuff means nothing. If you wanted to say, hey, high implied volatility, IV rank, and I want to be bullish. So I want to move the put side up further. I say perfect. You say high IV rank, and I want to be bearish on the stock. I would say, well, you know what, stocks had a six, seven percent move down. We typically like to play a little bit of a contrarian role. I would kind of shy away from that trade. Let's go a little bit more neutral just so that I can instill my will on you and my thinking so that we can move on with the learning process. But I like what you did there. But I don't like the way you sold it to me. You know what I'm saying? It's so easy. All that other stuff is just background noise. Makes sense? Yeah. Okay. Move the strikes out one. Just go wider. See what happens. You can click the thing too on top. Okay. Perfect. If I said we were going to do this strangle, what would you tell me? Has a higher probability of success than the last one? Yeah. I mean, it just, the premium that we're getting is not perfect with the risk. Stop right there. Stop right there. Your father, mentor, the guy who wipes your butt and change your diapers, who wipes your nose when you were three and is now looking to show you how to trade says a dollar is what I need to collect. Yeah. So that doesn't fit. Move it in two strikes. What's wrong with this trade? Can't get filled on the call. But why can't you get filled on the call? Let's get in it, it's illiquid. You've got the little, oh there we go. It came back. That's okay. That doesn't mean you can't be filled. That just means the market's a little bit wife what we like. So you'd have to take a second look at it, which is a great catch. I didn't see it. But what would be wrong with this one? If anything. If anything. I mean, it's slightly inside the standard deviation. So I mean, we like to be outside the one standard deviation. So. But you could do it. I'm saying like it doesn't, it still fits. You could go closer, closer, closer. It all still fits. It wouldn't have as high probability of success, but it all fits. All right. Let's widen the strikes back out to the standard deviation that we had a moment ago. 95, 109. Let's just put this in at 104. And if we have to move it, you'll go down a penny or two. Cool. All right. I want to, since we did that, I know you want to put on the trade. I want to talk about something that you did that doesn't happen in the short time frame that you were able to do yesterday in FCX. Yeah. So let's take a quick second to review what we did yesterday on a covered call. A covered call is just like any other type of strategy that we put on. We like to, we seem to have our profits, our 50% target at around 20 days. It's like a magic number, like 20, 23, 18, 27. Somewhere inside that 20-day timeframe on average, we have a chance to collect a 50% of our max profit. I should have wrote max profit in there. Okay. That max profit, there's only one way to figure it out. In FCX, you paid 1061 for the covered call, meaning you bought stock and you sold 11.5 call. I did the math up here for you. Where do I get the 11.5 from and where do I get the 1061 from? Well, the 11.5 was the call. So that's where we would be selling our shares at that price. So the amount that we received in premium minus the price of the stock when we bought it was or minus the call strike is where our max profit is. You can't make any more money over 11.50s, what you're trying to say. Yes. Right? So that's our max profit. We paid 1061. So we have risk from 1061 because we can't lose anything more than what we paid for it. So 1061 is our max, what we paid for it, that's how much we can lose. And we can only make up to 11.50. So we can only make that difference, which is 89 cents or 89 bucks. Today, FCX had a nice move up of around $1.20. You had a profit in there of not your target of 45 cents, but you had a profit in there of around 44%. You told me you did the math. Yeah, I was like 44%. 44% of the max profit is. 44% at 39 bucks. Right. It's not like it's not the dollar amount because it's a small dollar amount, $39. You only had $250 in margin being used. Yes. Right? I mean, it was like $230 or something like that of $240. So you had a small amount of money. Over night, you make 44% of your possible profit. You run like a thief in the night. Yeah, I mean, you can't add that much. I mean, it doesn't have there. A covered call is typically a slow moving strategy. You want the stock to slowly move up or fast move up, but stocks don't usually go up a $120, $10 or $11 stock. Over night. Doesn't go up 10% typically overnight. Yeah. You take the profit you run and you never look back. You don't break up the order. You don't try to make it into something else like buy back your call and sell a call higher or buy back your call and sell another call in a month. No, it's a gift. You take it and you run. All right. All right. Good job, Adiou. Good job. Listen, you've been doing this what? It'll be going on two weeks now. No more than that. I think three weeks, I think. Time flies when you have them from your son. Good job, Adiou. All right. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. What I normally say. Yes. We've done it so-that I can't help this.
