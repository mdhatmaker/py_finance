 I Think you're back Where do I start bang? Oh, so yeah, that's you that's your side. You can be like the dead fish hand did I yeah I apologize Speaking of dead fish how's your account doing today? It's a hundred and eighteen bucks operate on the day That's right, yeah, 120. Yeah, 127 I see up there you're still down about eighteen hundred bucks When we came on before we came on you like I'm not doing that great Don't look at your your P&L loss. I mean you have to be you know that's there. It's not going away You have to think about one brick at a time every day now to get there even faster than you're getting there You have to be cognizant of your Pricing Let's look at your canceled orders for a quick second here because you You rolled go all the way down the bottom All right, so you were gonna roll and open up your apple position So you have an apple September 110 straddle on and the stock Rallyed up to around one thirteen and change the other day. It came back down as what you needed You had some short dealt in there you were up a couple of dollars on the trade about Somewhere between ten twenty five bucks on the trade for the day and you wanted to roll from September to October Yeah, now let me look at your pricing here the first one you go in at a dollar fifteen Yeah, I say okay being a little bit aggressive You don't know what's gonna happen with the market next one you go in with it a dollar eight So you went from a dollar fifteen to a dollar eight so that just tells me that your pricing was really off from the very beginning Now let's go down a little and then you go down a one of five you don't get filled so now let me guess what was having to the stock The stock was starting to rally yeah, okay, so when the stock was going your direction and you were making some money back That's when you need to be aggressive with your pricing meaning like you got what you wanted don't think about what you might miss Do you know I'm trying you know I'm trying to say because hold on a second. Let's go to one oh five keep going One dollar canceled now. Let's go a little bit further one dollar cancel again. Let's go a little bit further. I know stop all right so You walked it from a dollar fifteen to a dollar Stock probably only moved about forty cents so You probably had a good chance to get filled at a buck oh five buck six buck four When the stock was moving in a direction like don't be a chaser try to do it into strength now We haven't since you've been on the show had that opportunity to roll into strength We've always been doing it from a defensive Play and that's the worst place to be like rolling to me As a reason why rolls a four four letter word it's like if you're rolling you're typically doing it as a defensive move And that's not a great Feeling and that's not a great thing, but when you have them your way be aggressive with your pricing because even if it continues going that way It works for you because you're not switching your position. You still wanted the stock to go down to 110 All right, so now let's look at what we did You tried to roll from September to October you went in a 380 credit So now what you're doing is you're just changing the September 110 straddle to the October 110 straddle I started looking for to roll it into a strangle That's why I did for for the dollar that the dollar credit you were moving the call up to the 115 call Yeah, I got it either one works, but since you couldn't get a dollar for the one you decided to get a little bit more credit for the other Okay, so you tried to roll for 380 keep going a 3.78 keep going 375 and then you got filled close that up for a minute And I got to tell the true story because we don't lie here on tasty trade open that up You got filled it a $3.72 credit, but what did you really go in at 370 370 so I wanted the fill all right, but because now you had to have it yeah yeah And you're moving it by nickels It cost you nothing to cancel and replace Move it by pennies you got filled at 370 to because the markets are tight and liquid and apple if that was a win or something else like that You might have been filled you know 20 25 cents off of what the mid price really should have been Now you asked me why do you get filled at 3.72? That's called price improvement That just means that the market is so competitive that even though you wanted to sell it at 370 Somebody said hold on here Sparky. I'll pay 3.72, which means there was probably a 3.73 bid somewhere That's nice that they helped dummy. That's that's great That is that worked in my favor. Yeah, they helped that that went in my favor this time and then to compound things You're selling five lots in GG when you're supposed to be trading that was a big bad fat finger because I wanted to sell a Naked putt in GG that was bat being in the wrong account That's true so you sold one putt in GG as a new trade open up the GG trade for a minute You're just selling a naked put using $280 worth of buying power you were thinking about doing a covered call And what I want what would I talk to you about was you know what? covered call lower probability of success than the Then the naked putt the naked covered call you can make more money Mm-hmm. Let's just call them both 65% probability of success 62% probability success They both have about the same probability of success Covered call has a little bit lower you can make more money The naked putt has a higher probability success you can make a little bit less I said let's not be that aggressive in GG. It's not something that we trade all the time. I don't even we don't have any gold exposure or You do have some mining exposure. So it's it's not a Correlated trade, but it's certainly stuff that you already have in your account unlike TLT which you put in there All right, so so naked putt Pretty classic trade. I think everybody can kind of understand it We always sell the strike that's basically one or two strikes out of the money in a low price stock like a 13 Half-dollar 13 dollar and six six and stock you're gonna be going one strike out of the money. Okay, perfect All good so now I have a question for you close up the cancel do orders and the field orders and GG Okay, you have another you have another Basically straddle on in Twitter now now I'm going to Twitter and we'll go to Monsanto in a minute But I want to go to Twitter open it up from it. You're up 30 bucks in here the stocks gone your direction It's gone to 28. That's what you wanted now you wished it had happened on expiration day and you were still in this trade Because this trade would be basically trading at around 30 cents each one of the options would be worth about 15 cents a piece at this time of the day Okay, but it's not it's it's 18 days worth of time left So why not while we're up in this stock and we got the move that we wanted why don't we try to do the same thing that you did in Apple But do it in Twitter why not like if it works in Apple? Why would you do in Twitter? Yeah, and I was actually thinking the same thing on Monsanto, but it's got earnings and a dividend in That kill you kill it for me kill this for you. Yeah, it's out of Monsanto Well, and now I was gonna trick you this is really good. Yeah, well, but I saw the same thing I mean Twitter moved in my direction this morning. It's up like a dollar 20 on the day or a dollar when I was looking at it And so I mean I was thinking that we would go To a strangle on the Twitter to go to move I agree Let's take a look. Let's go to the trade page But you're right Monsanto has earnings the following month so it just it just starts checking the boxes from for me to Want to close Monsanto at some time or stay in it more in September as opposed to going out to October earnings dividend I'd rather avoid them if I could make sense. Okay You can change the return on capital to position and you'll see that you're short the 28 straddle We're down about a hundred bucks on it. So when I look into become positive We got to first become even so we're looking to make back a dollar. That's what we're looking to do So let's see see if we can buy the 28 straddle That'll close out the trade that we have on and it'll hold down the control key and let's see what we can sell in October that's gonna give us around a $3 Well here, let me let me show you let's go to 26 call. Excuse me 26 put so now we're moving two strikes down and Let's go up to the 30 call Okay, so you can do that for a 19 cent debit now we like to do everything for a credit So I can move two strikes on either side and have about a 20 cent debit in the overall trade Here's where your market awareness. Here's where your opinion comes in We've been playing Twitter from the long side if you wanted to continue playing Twitter from the long side You would move up the October 26 put to the 27 put if you want and again It's only one strike. I mean, it's not like a humongous different Difference but it's that or move down the 30 call to the 29 strike or both Yeah, I was actually looking at the 27 I agree the 27 30 good In the worst case scenario, I could see myself light if If Twitter went below that 27 point I could see myself taking that Stock as shares. I mean and and just playing I'm playing some analysts that they liked it, but it's been it's been a pig. It's been terrible for the last Couple months, but yeah, this is a type of this is the type of adjustment Trade from strength. Mm-hmm Apple you were doing it from strength this you were doing it from strength others we've been doing from weakness I like this this makes sense to me. What am I trying to do? I'm trying to extend duration So I'm widening my sweet spot. I'm doing it for a credit I love for the credit to be a dollar 80 instead of 18 cents But I take what I can and I'm looking to make a dollar a full 100 bucks on this trade Okay, I think I think you do it. You want to go into an 18 cent credit? Now get a question for you Where do you want to route this order at what price? I mean if we're doing it into strength wouldn't we go a little bit above the mid price? Okay, so why? This is you run and right into your Apple bus saw that you had like I can see you're doing this at a 19 cent credit Seeing if you get filled the markets are two three cents wide But if you don't get filled at 19 you go put it at 18 you don't get filled at 18 you put it at 17 then you're done Yeah, let's put it in at 19 cents Hick and firm and send and send If we don't get filled there then we're gonna move it down to 18 cents and within a couple of seconds If you don't get filled there we'll move it down to 17 cents and hopefully we get filled there If we don't get filled 17 cents well, you'll have to move it down to 16 cents to get filled okay make sense Yeah, all right Well, you stole my thunder with no role in my and my Santos so What yeah, are we gonna I mean we're sticking to Monkley's because we could go weekly is if we Verde I mean like if we wanted to do that but I mean well the whole world is your oyster you can do anything you want You can trade e-liquid products if you want to start trading e-liquid products You could start trading oil futures that are a thousand dollars a point instead of a hundred dollars a point like a stock is I mean as a million things you can do or you can stick to the program The six-week expert that you are at this at this point and maybe You know what is it you got two years in one mouth listen twice as much as you speak I Got it. Let's take let's take a quick step back for a moment and talk about what we discussed today So we talked about a couple of things but really it's rolling and looking For your pricing on rolling especially when you're rolling into strength meaning when your positions making money for you You want to you want to be aggressive with your pricing like you want to be able to get filled because you're getting filled Not better because there's no substantive being getting filled better But you're getting filled because you want to be filled the stock is going in your direction So you're working with it at that time and at that time not letting it change not letting you chase it Okay, you start chasing it it makes it it makes it worse So we talked about rolling when we also talked about canceling and replacing Be aggressive with your canceling replacing it doesn't cost you anything to cancel replaces no ticket charge There's no commission so be aggressive with it You know what you want to go in a penny two or three above the mid price and you're watching the stock Okay, I get it But if you don't get filled start walking that order down until you do get filled and typically you get filled one or two cents around mid price All right, yeah, all right good job. I bet you I got a little Excited excited to get it on you were off by almost 20% we're gonna take a quick break who goes back now Tim night peace
