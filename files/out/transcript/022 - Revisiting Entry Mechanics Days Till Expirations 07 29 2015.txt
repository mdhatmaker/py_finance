 I'm going to be a good guy. I'm going to be a good guy. Mickey, where do I start? That versus bat. How are you? Doing well. How was my son today? Son is good today. Good. Well, I'm Tony Batista. This is my son. We're learning how to trade or go into the process. Hopefully everybody will come along with the journey. I also have a name at SNCC. It's not. It's June. Well, my mother is bad. Junior. You're not a junior? No. No. I get those on the live chat. I have one guy. That's his name. Abe. Abe. He gave me three choices. He said, oh, he's going to name me? Yeah, he said, okay, here are your three choices for what I'm going to call you every time we chat. He's a frequent chatter. So it was bad, junior. It was mini-bat, and then it was bat-in-ho, which is a, like, a Native American term for small. So like, bat-small. Okay. I kind of like that one too. I like that one too. Do you know what your name was going to be if it was up to your mother? Tyler. Yeah. You want to buy me a coffee someday? Well, we'll take the Saints name. But that's a good one. Thank you for that one. Yes, Tyler. She wanted to call you Ty. Ty. Oh, that's just precious. Not to rob it today. I just didn't, I know. I couldn't have it. Anyway. How's your day today? Oh, it was good. I mean, it was good. Okay. Yeah. Okay. You've been looking at the market a little bit today. What's the market doing today? E-minis are up about 15 NASDAQ. Up another 20. So you've been watching getting kind of engaged. Two weeks ago, when we first started this, three weeks ago, when we first started this, did you ever look at the market before or anything like that? Not really. Not really. And you were in the finance field, right? Yeah. Yeah. And a finger of the finance field, right? Mm-hmm. It's amazing, right? Like how things can change so much, like something that's been around for basically forever, you know, you don't really like look at it and watch it. And now it consumes, you know, your day while you're doing your other job. Mm-hmm. Two. But you do a good job on supporting everything. All right. So let's take a look at your account today, okay? So the first thing I want to take a look at is, let's just go to Do. And before we find the trade, and we have an idea of a trade that we want to go to, first thing I want to do is always just look at your overall account. Again, we're just going to that, like that green area there, also up on the top left there where it says that 66% that's your overall portfolio's probability of profit. Like that to be over 50%. Ideally wrapped around 68%. Because that's basically standard deviation. Um, like to have in a perfect world, is a perfect world. This is not like what happens. Like if it may affect, if you looked at your account two days ago, your green area was more, more bullish because the market had been going a little bit lower. Now it's more in the middle of, uh, the middle of the range. Okay. So I like everything that's happening with your account, probably of profit, everything else like that. You only have, you know, four, three or four or five trades, um, in your account. So we want to put on another trade in your account. What's the first thing that you would do and what I like to do every time I'm looking to make a trade? You're under the grid. Okay. And then, uh, like to, uh, filter out earnings and, um, set our IV range, IVR range to be 50 to 100. So we'll, uh, we'll do, uh, yeah, 50 to 100 there. And then the earnings range will be, uh, 23 days. So we don't want earnings within 23 days right now or 45 is our, um, this is what I want to talk about a little bit today. So 45 is our, is our wheelhouse. Now, with 23 days left to expiration, which you are correct in August of 23 days, we're kind of, we're kind of in like no man's land in my eyes, because you have 51 days to September. I don't like to trade the weeklies on a longer term basis, longer term basis for us is 45 days. So I prefer if I could, especially as a new trader, like I'm trying to think about like you and everybody else will be listening to this as a new trader, I would rather default to closer to 45, which would bring us to 51 days. All things being equal. Okay. Does that make sense? So let's change that from 45 days to 51 days, which gets us to expiration. Because if we set it to 45 days, and a stock has earnings 47 or 48 or 49 days, inside that September expiration, it would be filtering it out and kind of give us a false reading. So if I go to expiration with 51 days, it's going to have no earnings inside that 51 days. Okay. I don't think it's going to change anything here, but I think it's just good mechanics. Yeah. And I actually had a chat today about the same idea, and one of the other things that I came up with, well, that I thought about was also the liquidity at, you know, wouldn't you prefer to go to the more, if you're in the middle of that range, where you have two expressions that are one outside the 45 range, one inside the range. Much tighter. Wouldn't you want to go to one that has more liquidity? You sure will. But let me, I'll just tell you, the front month with 20 summer days is always going to be more liquid than the back month. Just because at the back month, there are a lot of things. Just more people watching it. And also all the trades that have been made for the last 20 summer days, everybody's looking to make new ones adjust, close, open, tweak. There's always going to be a lot more liquidity and probably tighter markets in the shorter term, regular monthly options. Okay. So yeah, you want it, and it's in liquidity as king, but you kind of take a little liberty with the overall rule. Okay. Sounds good. Let's just click on that. Alright, so the top one, new month mining, 92% was actually 100 last couple of days, or close to 100. So it's actually come down a little bit, not a lot. At 92, it still is high. You'll notice that FCX was 100. It's down to 80. Now that's the last trade that you made. New month mining, FCX, both in the same type of field, gold mining, exploration, worldwide, blah, blah, blah. This stock was actually, have you watched it a little bit today? You actually sent me an IM. What did you really want to say? About 30 or 40 minutes ago, I was like, all right, I want to do any, I'm like, I want to do a cover call strategy, it's similar to what we did in FCX. And why do you want to do a cover call strategy? I mean, it's in that, obviously, the IVR is high. So, you know, selling that short call option, you know, I'm getting high premium value for that. Okay. And then it's a lower value stock price. So, I'm not, it doesn't cost me a ton to do it. I mean, it would be... Perfect. Perfect to sit, man. High implied volatility, low stock price. Perfect. That's all simple, some stuff. We're going to have to complicate it. It's perfect, did great. Okay, so, if we had an FCX trade on, which is basically in the same field, and you already have a gold iron condor trade on, then I probably wouldn't be looking at this trade. I'd be trying to look at something else. Makes sense? I just to not have all our X in the same type of... Call of correlated. Call of correlation. Don't want to have a correlated portfolio. Makes sense? All right, let's double click on an EM. I always take a little Wizard of Oz when I set an EM. I don't know why. I think it's an ATM. You know, I'm going to have to deposit a Vases. Okay. Strategy, you said, covered call. So, let's click on strategy. And let's go down to covered stock. And you can see in the advanced settings there, if we're in the right month, you can change it if you want to. So, let's make that 45 days. And as long as you have the weeklies unclicked on the right there, it's going to default to the closest monthly to 45 days, which is going to be September. So, you can always have that set at 45, and I guess we'll do the math for you. Okay, let's click go. So, we're looking to buy stock. That's the gray one... I'm sorry, the green one, that's kind of like a little bit lighter, just to show you that you're buying stock. So, the $1,1663 is probably the mid price of the offer. And then you're looking to sell the $18 call of defaults to the first call out of the money. Totally a complete and good setup. $16.55 is what you're paying for it, so what do you think your break even is? Put a circle of something around $16.55 you could. Is $16.55, that's my break even. All right, it's perfect. Not a trick question, I'm not trying to trick you anything else like that. You can also see where that red line is, and if you click, I think if you click that dollar sign, it'll also tell you how much like your buying power is, but it tells you your break even. Now, your buying power on this is not $1600. We don't have access to your back end in your account, so we default to the highest that it can be. And that would be like an IRA account. You'd be spending $654. And the highest here is the max loss. So, I mean... You're highest here is $1655. The stock could go to zero, I mean, it's been around since the 1900s. It could go to zero, but I doubt it. The brokerage firm holds about $300. No, excuse me, for a covered call about $500 to make this trade. Okay. All right, so you're risking $500. That's what I would think my max risk is to make how much? It'll be whatever I'm selling the call for, so $105. Plus... Plus... Well, you know what? Let's just do the math for you. Just click on it. All right, so your max profit on here is going to be $146. It's the difference between where the stock is right now. It was around $17.60 or something like that. The call strike, which is 18, so that's $40. Plus the 105 or 108 that you are selling the call for for a total of $143, $145, depending on how the stock is moving. So it's not just how much you're selling the call for because you're low on the stock. It's the difference between the stock and that call strike. Remember, the strike is where somebody is willing... You're getting somebody the right to buy your stock at. So you're giving them the right to buy it at 18. It's trading at $17.60, so you can make $40 there. But you're charging them some sort of premium. That premium was the $105 for the call. So you can make a total of around $145 on this covered call. I would unclick that for a quick second. And we're almost running out of time. About a 60%-59% probability of success. This is the classic thing that we did last time, classic covered call. Can I show you what Naked put for a moment? Okay, let's just unclear this and then sell the 17-put for me. Okay, so the 17-put has about a 65% probability of success. Slightly more. You're selling this for 93 cents. So what's your max profit? 93. 93 cents. What would be your break even? It'll be at whatever the strike is now minus the 93 cents. Which brings you to $16.07? Yeah. Right? Yeah, $16.70. $16.07. No, $16.70. We're at 93 cents. Stocks at 17.61. Ah, forget about the stock. You're not doing anything with stock here. You're just selling a put. A put when you sell a put, an easy way to think about it is, somebody can put stock to you. They can put stock to you at your strike price, which is 17. But you're charging them premium. You're charging them $93. So that $93 is yours. That's yours to keep, yours to have right now. So if somebody puts stock for you at 17, but you charge them $93, you break even 16.07. Okay. Now just click the button for a quick second. I mean, it does all the math for you. It's all here for you. But it's so much better. Like, I used to hate the Analyze tab on Toss, because people would use it as a crutch. If you could do the math and understand it, well, if you could do the math, then you understand it. If you look at a picture, it's a great visual, but I'm not sure you understand it. Does that make sense? Because just read off a calculator. All right. So let's go back to that trade. Which one do you want to do? Let's weigh them out. One, you make around $93 on, but you have a 65% probability of success, and a lower break even, which is good for you. The other one, you can make $145, have a higher, have a lower probability of success, and a lower break even point. Meaning, I shouldn't say lower breaking up. Your break even is closer, meaning, higher probability that you can get touched. I mean, honestly. This one uses $300. The other one uses $500. All things being equal, there's not a huge variance. You're 100% correct. Yeah, I would go, in my opinion, because I want to take a little bit more risk, I would go at the cover call, and give myself a little bit more potential. You know, potential profits. Perfect. There's no wrong answer. Because the setup, the mechanics work. So let's take a quick second here, and let's just kind of review what we went through. And the only thing that we tried to discuss here today was a difference between a covered call, and a short put, naked put. They're both bullish positions. They both want the same thing to happen. They've both very similar in break even points. One was about $0.50 higher than the other one. They both use around the same amount of money. They both use around $1,600. The caveat I would put towards this, you're in a margin account. So it's about the same trade. If you'll as in an IRA account, I'd probably do the covered call, because it uses just about the same amount as buying power as the naked put. But the covered call I can make $145, and the naked put I can only make about $94. Makes sense? Yeah. Good job, Addy. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. What do I say? Peace. Peace.
