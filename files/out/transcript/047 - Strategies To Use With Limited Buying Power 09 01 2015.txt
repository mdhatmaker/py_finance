 I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna tell you a quick little story. We don't have a lot of times so hopefully we'll get everything but maybe I can make this day when the dow is down 400, you're down about $500 in your overall account and it seems like the products where we've used the most buying power. Those are the trades that you need to at least not hurt you the most and those are the ones that have hurt you the most. You can always look at your buying power reduction to figure out where your most risk is. Your most risk is in Apple. You have another one in it looks like Monsanto. Win is your largest loser to date. It's horrible. It's not fun. Not fun. Not fun. So let me tell you a story. Your father actually got to the floor of CBW in 1980. I started trading in 1983. Yeah, to be 21 years old to start trading. I also had to save $5,000. I didn't have $5,000 so it took me three years to save $5,000. In early in 1984, maybe the end of 1983, it was 1984 actually. Because I started just to have to Christmas because I had to get my Christmas bonus to actually make my $5,000. The dow was up $50 for the first time ever. It never happened before in history. And on that day I had an out trade. An out trade is just something. Everything's not electronic like it is today. I'd write something down on a card and then I would hand it to my clerk. She would go and check it with somebody else who I did the trade with and they would take that card upstairs and they would type it in and go through the system and eventually at the end of the day they'd all match up. Long story short, I made a trade with a guy who stood right next to me. We could talk to each other. I thought I did something. He thought he did something else and it basically busted me out. I was thinking it was the only time in my career when I didn't have any money in my account. So that day I traded with a small debit in my account and made a couple of dollars. I was under my limit of what I could trade with. The brokerage firm that I cleared through, the market making firm that I cleared through Branth Associates. Harry Brant was still alive but he was running the place then. He actually sold to first stop in Spear Leads Kellogg which ends up becoming Goldman Sachs. He allows me to trade with much less than the minimum that you needed which by the way the minimum was $5,000 at the time. And then I moved on with my career. So how did I move on with my career after being... You're down 2300 and $30,000 account. You're down $500 today. You've had a quick start. You were up around four, five hundred bucks and now you've been down as much as four thousand. But the reason I told you that story was you have to have number of occurrences. You gotta keep doing what you know will get you there. Now you may have to do different things, you may have to do things slightly differently. Like you're using $20,000 worth of buying power in your account of a $30,000 account. You can't ramp it up to $30,000 today. Now somebody would a larger account, let's say a $1,000 or $250,000 or a million dollars might be using 30, 40, 50% of their account, 60% of their account like you are, 66% of their account. They might ramp it up, be able to put on the same type of trades that they've always put on, strangles, straddles, more buying power trades than you can. So I told you this whole story because I wanted you to think about the type of trade that uses the least amount of buying power for a smaller size account that takes advantage of high implied volatility, which is the highest. Just go to a four-slush VX by the way. Volatility's moved 100% in the last week or so. There you go, 95% increase from around $15 to almost $30 in the last 10 days alone. That's a year move. That up there I think is a six-month or it's a year-to-date chart. That's a year move in volatility. It took a year from volatility to get from $30 to $15. It took one week to get from $15 to $30. So how do we take advantage of that using the least amount of buying power? What would be the type of strategy you would use? Iron condors? Sure. Sure. And the same way when I was trading back on the floor, I would have to close out all my positions at the end of the day because I didn't have any margin to keep trades overnight and not take advantage of any type of movement and overnight, which all the market makers were able to do, you're in the same type of situation. You've got to do strategies that don't use a lot of buying power. Iron condors would be the one. What stock would you like to do in iron condor? I was looking at Microsoft. Okay. What are the other end of the yields? And then I was looking at DIA. The diamonds, the diamonds, the markets are way too wide in there. Way too wide. I mean, they're 10 cents wide for the, here, since the diamonds are going to move the same way as PY, IW, I'm going to the Qs are going to move. I'd rather see you use one of those three than use the diamonds. Okay. Okay. And I know you already have positions in there, but maybe we can go in there too. Let's, since we have the charts up there, let's just go to Microsoft for a quick moment. I know Microsoft's gotten beaten up. It's down about 10% I think over the last 10 days or so. 11% trading $4195, okay, stocks down a buck and change. It looks like $1.50 or so. A little over 3% today. All right. What do you want to do in there? Let's go to Do. High implied volatility rank 89%. Yeah. The highest it's been for the year. Okay. I love it. I was looking at two of them. I had a $3 wide and a $2 wide. Let's, let's, let's since volatility is high. Let's go wider. I mean, you know, it's $300 worth of buying power. So if $3,000 worth of buying power with a, with a, with a strangler, something like that, you're going 45 days out. That's $5 with less change that to three. Okay. Click go. Now, most of our research is shown that a $3 wide iron condor is about the sweet spot for buying power reduction. I don't know if you stumbled on this or you knew this, but buying power reduction to risk versus reward. We like to collect around one third of the with the strikes. What strikes were you looking at? I was at, on the put side, I was at a 40 short and a 37 long. So the 40, 37 puts bread. Yep. And then on the call side, I was at the 46, 49. And it looks like it's right around 99 cents is the mid price. Okay. Listen, it's a 50, 50 shot. Yeah. So, so here, if we were doing a, a strangle using more buying power, we'd be able to go to the same distance that we normally would go and collect a higher premium. Or we'd be able to go further out and look to collect a dollar, we're like to collect around a dollar on the trade for about a, you know, 70% probably success on the trade. Here, you're able to go possibly a strike wider than you would have been able to go, you know, two weeks ago, a month ago, you know, two months ago, that's the advantage you have here. And the reason why we talk about this trade being good for a account that has limited amount of buying powers, you only have margin on one side. If you're selling the spread for a dollar for argument six, it's going to take $200 worth of buying power because the stock can't close over 49 at expiration and under 37. The brokerage from recognizes that. So your risk is only the $200. The $100 credit plus the width of the strikes being $3 total, $201. All right. I won it 99 cents and you can adjust this down by a penny or so. I wouldn't move it much more than that. Maybe two pennies at best if you want to get filled. I want you to have a number of occurrences on because I don't want you to be afraid to put on more trades. Okay. Can I come up with one? Yeah. Can I just come up with one in case you don't get filled in this? Can we talk about Microsoft for one second? Go back to that. Just click on undo so we can go back to what he had on. Okay. Perfect. Okay. So that's the strikes you had on. Let's take off that 37 put for a second. Now this is a Jade Lizard. We're selling a call spread. Selling the naked put. Your probably a success goes up by about 10 percent. Maybe a little bit less. You're collecting $1.52. Stock's been beaten up around 11 percent. Meaning, our research has shown when a stock has gone down around 10 percent in the last 10 days or less that typically you can get a little bit of a bounce up. Now I don't know if you get that in this market but that would be another consideration. So if you don't get, it's going to use about $600 worth of buying power instead of $200 worth of buying power. So because the stock is a cheaper price stock meaning it's only $40, not a hundred quarters. You're not using that much buying power. So if you don't get filled in the one, your decision, whichever one you pick, all you're doing is taking off that one side, giving yourself downside risk more than $200 downside risk of a couple of thousand theoretically but the U600 dollars worth of buying power. Let's look at IWM. You have a short call spread and IWM against basically one by two. Put spread and SPY and a naked short call and SPY. You're losing about, I'll just look here. We don't have to go to, you lose about $200 in SPY and you're making about $60 or so in IWM. Your overall account is leaning a little bit long about 60 delta's that 60 shares of SPY. We were short about 40 shares of SPY going into this move over the last couple of days. All right. Let's go to IWM, let's go to strategies. Let's do the same thing. Let's go to an iron condor. My buying power is no better than your buying power in your account. 45 days. I'm going to widen the strikes to five. So let's change the width from three to five. You can make it to, make it 60% probability of being in the money because that's about what you were maybe a little bit less. Click on go. All right. I gave you a little bit of your history on what your deltas were because I wanted you to think about what I'm going to do now. What I want to do is I want to sell a call spread right where it is, the one 16, 121. So that brings us about three and a half dollars away on the call side. Let's move our put side down further. Let's go to like 102, 97. So what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to get a little bit of, you did a completely neutral trade in Microsoft. If you just sell the naked put it would make a little bit more bullish. Here I'm skewing it to the downside a little bit to give myself a little bit room to the downside, but also to give me the short deltas that I think your account needs. Mid price at 224. That's the kind of trade I'd like to make. And I'd even high IV rank 67%. I would go into the diamonds too, just like you. But the diamonds just have, you know, too high. Yeah. I was looking at a $5 wide iron condor there as well for around the same credit. Look at better markets in here. Yeah. It gives you a little bit of short delta like it shows you at 13. You had about 60, we're reducing, you know, about 10% and 20%. Okay. Sound good? Yeah. All right, let's go into $2.23, which is the mid price. We get a little bit of a rally or probably get filled just because our call size is a little bit closer. All right. Let's take a quick second here just to think about what we discussed. We discussed a couple of things. What to do in buying power is an issue. You know, you don't have all the money when it's tied up in other products. Number of occurrences, like you have to, this is October with 45 days to go and high implied volatility. 45 days to go is the perfect time from our research to put on trades. But you know what, you limited by what you have and what you left with. The only other thing that I would have liked to have gotten to, which we didn't get a chance to, was win. We could talk about rolling down win, but we can do that tomorrow. Okay. All right. Yeah. You almost got a $20 loss in win. How we could make that only an $8 loss if things can work out a little bit with us. You know, a lot of the positions that you have on are exactly where they should be, meaning if it was expiration. In OIH, you're short to 29.31. 29 call, 31 call. The stock is right there at 30 and a half, right in between your short strikes. You're not making any money in that position. The volatility is just killing the prices. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. What do I normally say? That's good job.
