 I'm doing well. Happy birthday. I mean, it's not enough that we spend 15 minutes together every day. I have to have a shirt with your face on. Is it too much to spend 15 minutes with your phone? No, no, that's great. That's the best part. For those who don't know, this is my son, Nikki, a new trader, really never traded before, correct? Yeah, we're going to do the first one today. Okay. All right. So you told me, what did you tell me on the break when you sat in here? Well, yesterday I came in a little over Zalus. I didn't really know what I was doing and today you do. Oh, yeah, today I've changed completely. I'm a new man today. But today I wanted to at least make it easier on myself and kind of use some of the programs that we have at our fingertips. Okay, good. So what do you have planned? So what do you what is it until so that entails two stocks that don't have earnings? Okay, so I have always had a thing where and Tom do it, Tom and I do it on the show also we don't talk about anything in advanced in advance of the show because we want it to be spontaneous, just want it to be fresh, want to be new and I want you, you're in a tough situation because I want you to make, I mean, I don't want you to make mistakes, but I want you to make the mistakes that a new trader is going to make so that everybody at home who has never seen the dough platform before or used it and quite frankly, I don't use it enough. I want them to see the mistakes that you make you doing it and finding a stock so that we can so that they can learn from the process too. So okay, so what do you have planned? So what I want to do is I want to go into dough, use the grid and you know filter by a stock by our criteria and like I told you on the second show, on the second show, you did do it on the third or the fourth show. Yes, yes, but today, so you're following, so you're going to follow, here's a difference, here's a difference, is that today I'm controlling. Okay, so let's put your computer up there and okay, so that's you, right? You're moving your mouse. That's your account. Yeah, it has about $30,000 in it. That's what we always start with or that's what we start with past shows that we do. So you got about $30,000 in it to margin account that allows you to do basically anything that you want to do as long as you have the buying power reduction to make the trade. I mean, as long as you have enough money in the account that the broker firm holds and leverage, you can make any trade on the Sun. That's futures options, stock, whatever you want. Naked, not naked, any strategy that you want. You welcome. Thank you, thank you. So we're going to go to the grid page on the left hand side. Okay. And from here, we'll filter by a high options volume. So that's one of our criteria that we're going to start with. Okay, so stop right there. And truth be told, when we started the show in the break there, you told me what you were going to go to. So I'm going to go to this high option volume. What did I tell you to go to? I said, you'd be high option. Naked, this is why you had to sit out that one football game, you know, you listen, but you just miss it. Notable stocks, notable stocks, not high option volume. But let's go to high option volume because that's what we're looking for. We got to find something that has perfect. Let's go to high option volume stocks. Okay. Good. And then we're going to do the filters, the ones with the blue circle, the ones that don't look like a target sign, those are the ones that are selected. So we want to exclude earnings within a certain range. And we're going to put that to 45. That's fine. And now 45 days is our is our wheelhouse. I usually, and 45 days is perfect to have that. So you're excluding all earnings inside zero to 45 days. Yeah. Because one of the things that we looked at, one of the things we talked about was we wanted no earnings. That's perfect. So good. The next criteria, we're going above 50, I, I, VR on this, right? I, VR is IV rank. It's really just an average. It's 49, 51, 45. It doesn't really matter. Okay. So the next thing, and I didn't show it to you, click on the implied valve rank right there. Okay. So that'll sort all of the tiles high to low or low to high. So in yours, if you click it one more time, it'll make it 50 to 100. You'll notice that FIT has 51. Click it again. And now on the left hand side, there you have Asher with 100 and will bring it down to 50. When we're selling premium, we prefer the higher implied volatility. Okay. So I wanted to go into Costco because Costco. Okay. So stop. First trade, we want high implied volatility. We love volatility between 50 and 100. 100 being better than 50. Costco has an IV rank of 54. Yes, it meets the criteria. If it was my 30th trade in my month of trading, I'd say sure. Go to Costco. If it was my first trade, I personally wouldn't go there. I'd try to stick to the one. Stay where you are. I would personally want to be in the 100. But let's go to Costco. It works. Go ahead. So I'm going to click on the trade button and it'll pull up my Costco. Okay. I usually like to work on the curve to start with just because I'm a visual learner. So I like to see it. Okay. You know, before we go with it. Yeah. And listen, I'm just going to give you my two cents along with you. When Doe first came out, we only had the curve view. We didn't have a table view. We only had a curve view. And then Tom and myself and a bunch of other people all talked about, said, let's put a table view in there too, which is more in the style of toss, think or swim the way it looks. But I like to curve as a visualization too. And I think as a new trader, the curve view with that win and loss and green and red is a good indication, a good way of visualizing something. I grew with 100%. Okay. So what are we looking at? So although we're not at the highest end of IVR that we can be, I figure that Costco it's been up and the whole openheimer fund says that this is, you know, buy this by that. So I figure we play that and we do a call to the downside. Heimer, last Heimer, Heimer, Heimer, buy this by that. Okay. So whoever this person is knows more about, well, I'm saying maybe somebody's listening to him or, you know, so because it's up $3.50 because you think it was this news, this is why it stocks up. So you're going to fade that move. Yeah. Some of fade that I'm going to go against the view. Okay. And you said this stock's been up or higher or something like that, right? Today. Today. Today. It's been up to bucks today. Let's bend some up over the last couple days. What does it say it's up? Today, $351.00. Right. So it's not up $2.00. It's up $3.50. That's actually a pretty big move, right? Yeah. Okay. So all right. Okay. All right. I like what you're saying. I like what you're saying. We'll go over tomorrow. The different things. Okay. So what do you go ahead? All right. So we're going to sell a call on this. So you want to sell a naked call. Do you know how much? Do you know how much? Sorry. So go ahead. Which call are you going to sell? First of all, you're going to be in what month? I'm going to be in August at 42 days out. Okay. So you are in August 42 days out. And the strikes that we have on there are $5 wide, right? There's the one. Are you in August with? Yeah. I'm in. Okay. Perfect. 42 days out. So you can see the in the middle of here is how many days out that very good. It's a joke you just made. I like that. No. You listen, you know the dough platform a lot better than I do. So you should point out these things. This is going to be awesome. All right. So you're selling that call at it looks like a mid price of around $2.17. Say $2.15. Okay. Well, the natural is 2.15. Go ahead. That was kind of my question was like if you know the difference between a 145 strike and a 150 strike. You know, 150 strike. Mm-hmm. It went from 170 from Sorat like, you know, 50 cents, let's say. What are the 40 46? 46 and that's enough. 30. Are you talking about the change in the? One option is $2.15. You can see it on the left hand side. Yeah. Right on the bottom. Right. Okay. Stay right there. And that option 70 cents. So you sell one option, the 145 option. Stay right where you are. You can sell the 150 call. You have an 80% probability of success. It's high. It's great. We like to have a wheelhouse. Remember, you can only control entry. Risk and everything is controlled on entry period. You can't control something after the fact. What's that? That's okay. All right. So 70 70 cents. Let's just round 70 cents. Do you know how much buying power reduction you're using for this trade? Probably a lot. Right. Unfortunately, in Doe, we're subject to only the information that we get from the website, TD Ameritrade's website that we feed off of. And it shows max loss of unlimited. It doesn't give you a buying power reduction. It's about 20% of the stock. It's about $2,600 to sell one call to make 70 bucks. We would want to manage that trade at a 50% profit, which would be $35. So stop. Now worth the time. For that reason, there's probably no, it's worth the time. That strike's probably not worth the time. So let's go back to the 145. There are only $5 wide strikes. Okay. Now the stocks 143. You're selling a 145 call. You went from a 80% probability of success to about a 69% probability of success. Let's just round it and say 70. 80% to make 70 cents, 70% to make $2.8. For me, $2.8, at least I'm using $2,600 to possibly make $208, which we would look to manage at somewhere around $100. Now all of a sudden, you're becoming a little bit more, to me, a little bit more in my wheelhouse. For us on entry, we like to sell something for at least a dollar. So if I'm going to sell a naked call or a naked put, or I'm going to sell a naked call and a naked put combined, I want to collect at least a dollar. That's my criteria. So you want to sell this call with 42 days to go to expiration for $2.8. Your break even on it, click it one time, is going to be the credit received plus the strike price. 145 plus 208 is 147.08 and you can see that right where it says max profit, winds up being less than or equal to $147.9. It must have taken the penny. Your maximum possible profit is 209. Do you know what that chart is on the right hand side? That chart on the right hand side tells you the amount of days it takes to possibly make 50% on the trade. All right, so let's unclick that for a second. Get out of it. Okay, this is your trade. If this is the trade you want to make, I'm going to let you make it. Because you have to make these mistakes yourself, and then tomorrow I'll show you what I think you should do, like on Monday. All right, so let's go with that. Okay, perfect. So let's put it in. What's the, go ahead. You've got to click it. So hold on a second. Hold on before you click it, go back for a minute. Up or right, just click on the X. It's okay. Stop clicking around. You like your like your money. You're like your all over the place. Relax. Actually, I think you've been here once or twice. Even though it's your only first time. This is the first one. So the market is 209, 221. Mid price is 215. So let's change your price down at the bottom left. To 215. Up to get it. Okay, now you can hit confirm and send, or review and send. And now you can click send on the right hand side. Good. Okay, you're filled. You sold your first option. You sold your first call. Bullish a bear strategy. Bearish strategy. You want the stock to go lower? We'll stay the same. We'll stay the same. Take take Nicky off his computer for a minute and let's look at a chart of Costco and I know we have a minute or two left or less. Because I just want, I just want to go back to the statement where you said here's a chart of Costco. You said it's been going higher. It has been going higher over the last four four days or so. I have no problem making this trade because you did everything you were supposed to do. You looked for high implied volatility, a little bit of a contrarian role, high probability trade. Now it's up to the option gods. All right, let's think about what let's let's review what we learned here for a moment. So the only thing the only thing that we can control is entry. And that's what you were doing today when you sold one contract thought about how much premium you were using $2600 and how much money you were going to receive and your probability success. The only thing I think that you should have done different in my eyes was look for an ETF because the markets would just would be a little bit tighter. But I love what you did here. You did perfect. You did everything I asked you. What do you think you're probably successes on this trade? I'm just 68 percent. That's what it was at the beginning. Have a great weekend. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. Tim Knight, a rerun of Tim Knight. What do we say? Peace.
