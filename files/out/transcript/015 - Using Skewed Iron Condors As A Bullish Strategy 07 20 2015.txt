 What do I start? Bat vs. Bat. How are you, my man? Well, thanks. Have a nice weekend and see you this weekend. I did. I was at a wedding. I had some fun. Good. High school friends, old college friends, aerosus. It was a good time. Good time. That's why I didn't see you on Sunday. I figured you were. Yes, yes. Sunday was Saturday. Day of rest for me. Day of rest. I think you sent me a text message and said, you're not getting off the couch. Something like that. Yeah, I was feeling hurt. Yeah. So you're maturing, but you're not there yet. Not there yet. Got it. Got it. Okay, so enough chitchat. Make up for the weekend and we didn't see each other. Okay, so what's the market doing to your account? It's been good. I mean, it's all my positions have looked okay. So what's the market doing? Look, I mean, well, I know what the market's doing every day. So you handle some things. Hold on, you handle support. It takes the trade, right? Talk to customers all day long. You're supposed to be instrumental on what's going on with Do. I ask you, what's the market doing? And you got to look. Yeah. You may as up five points, five and a half. For every been all day. Thinking up around five points, right? Okay, where's the overall market? High, low, medium, extreme in market for what? You're a trader. You tell me. Yeah. I mean, so what's the market mean to you? Let's put a chart up of SPY that's standing in ports 500. So let's just take a look at the S&P 500. SPY's been down. No. No. There you have it. You got to get you away from your mother. What's what's what is SPY done? Well, it's like it's unchanged over the last 30 days. That's a that's a you know, that's a six. That's a six month chart. Basically a year to date. So we're up. If you look on the left hand side, this is what I want you to have set up on your charts. So if you look on the left hand side, the IV rank, 2.3%. That's extremely low. Do you see it in right on the left? Okay. Price change up 4.4%. That's in the last 10 days. If you you shouldn't know how to do this and you shouldn't have to put on your own charts so that you can see what's going on. So you have this in your. So if I ask like, what's going on with the market? Yeah, you're right. Like, I don't know. Tell me what in what time frame? What do you what do you mean? What's going on with the market? We're at all time highs. That's that's a given. What's the market been doing recently? Well, I mean, I guess you could say if you if you discount the last 10 days, we've been going we were we were starting to go a little bit lower. But now we've come back, right? So you've got markets at all time highs. You've only got three positions on. We want to have a lot more positions on. But we're trying to go slow yet fast. Is this a market extreme? I don't think so. I mean, why? I mean, it's an opinion. I don't know what is it. Do you know what? I have one more homework because I'm a for you. Can you handle it? I need you to Google search when you don't want to show market extremes or the definition of market extremes. I dare you to find the definition of market extremes because they don't quantify it. Nobody talks about it. Well, and aren't there many different markets? I mean, if I said what are the market extremes for a specific stock or for commodities or for, I mean, aren't they, are they all together as one or king and consider them separate? You played football out when you were growing up, right? If you missed, played defense offense, you played both, right? If you missed two plays in ten plays, would that be a market extreme? No. Why aren't you in on every play? If you missed two, would that be extreme? Yes. If you missed one, would that be extreme? Yes. Well, you can't win without your best player on the field. Well, it's a good thing you follow as a coach. Anyway, I understand. What I'm trying to say here is you have to quantify it somehow. You have to say something. Like, you have to put it into perspective so that every time. So we look at ten days. If the markets moved 5% or more typically between 5% and 10% in a 10-day period, that's that number on the left hand side where you look at an SPY of 4%, we say that that's kind of a market extreme or something for us to look at. That's not my point. So we're getting there now. We aren't getting there on the market. Let's look at GLD for a moment. We have low implied volatility in SPY. Okay, so now GLD, 52% IV rank. Higher IV rank gives us a lot more things that we can trade. So this is at an extreme too. It's moved 5, 5 dollars and 44 cents. 5.4%. Not dollars. Yes, 100%. So if I asked you, is GLD at an extreme the way we quantify it, you might say, yeah, it is. It's actually at a five-year lower, around a four-year lower, something like that. That fact means nothing to me. Because I deal in a 45, 30 to 45 to 60, 45 days being the perfect range. So for me, I wonder what's going on right now. How many downs have you missed this game? I don't care for the last three years how many you missed. I'm looking right now and I want to see right now. So GLD in my eyes is at a market extreme. Okay, let's go to your account. We'll just stay right in the place that we're at. Okay, so you've got an overall probability of profit on your account of 72%. That's high and that's good, especially in this market condition that we're in. But we only have three positions on. Let's be fair. And you've got a small amount of, well listen, everything is relative, but you have $300, $325 in extrinsic value to make this month on your overall position. Okay, did you know that you can click on each individual position to see, to see the risk graph on each one? Let's take a look at that. Unclick all of them and just click on Costco. Okay, so if you click on Costco, it gives you a risk graph. So you don't have to know anything about options here, but you could tell if that white circle is where the stock is right now and green is good and red is bad. The more it increases the risk of gets for that trade. In that trade. Let's unclick Costco and look at Netflix. Now that first position that you have in Costco is an iron condor. Well, it's a, is a strangle. Yeah, this one you have on is a, you know what it is? This is our butterfly. Butterflies actually a broken wing butterfly. Perfect, because we did it for a $1 credit. One Sank credits, so it cuts out the risk below the lowest strike points. That's correct. You have no risk to one side. And you just, you just did a, you did a good trade a term for a moment there. Like you said $1 and then you corrected it to $1. In our world, $1 is $1. If you told me you did this for a $1 credit, I would think you did it for $100 credit. So this is just a big difference. Big difference. But as you start learning the terminology and everybody else starts learning the terminology out there, they'll start doing the same thing. Okay, this one in Netflix, although you have no risk to the downside, you wouldn't mind if it went up $1 or $2 or $3 in the next, you know, 30 some odd days. That's unclick Netflix and go to TLT. Okay, TLT, you have an iron condor on equal risk on both sides, stocks right in the middle. Okay, nothing. So you're a whole account, you know, for what it's worth, neutral, neutral. You're a whole position, click them all for me for a moment, because it's going to make it well. There you go. You're up around $49.50, so since we started last week, and it looks like you're up about $28 today. Not bad. Yeah. On $4,000 worth of risk. I don't know, it's a pretty good rate of return. Yeah. You were in the business for a while, that's pretty good. Yeah. Okay, but we haven't booked anything, so it doesn't matter. All right, let's go back to what our market, what we feel is a market extreme the way we quantify it, and the way we present it. Let's go into GLD, we'll go to the Trade tab. Okay, so the first thing that we want to do is we want to be in the August monthlies, that's the one that we always go to, and that's what we have there. We like monthly options, I shouldn't say, always August. Always the monthly options. Around 20 to 25 days, it's going to be the last time that we would put on a trade in that front month. We probably look to the back month after that. Okay, what kind of trade do you want to put on in GLD? You have a broken wing butterfly, you have a strangle on, and you have an iron condor. So let's go... Bullish or bearish? Let's go bullish on gold. Okay, because you have to have an opinion, right? Yeah. You can have a neutral position, but you have to have a position. Okay, so what do you want to do? Let's go with some, let's get long, a long call vertical maybe, or... Okay, so hold on a second. What do we have? High implied volatility, a low implied volatility. We have high implied volatility. High V rank, so long call spread. You know, it doesn't fit there. Yeah, you don't want to be buying. Right. So we could do, I mean, we could do a short put spread. Perfect, stop right there. Don't complicate it. Let's do a short put spread. Let's go to the curve view, just for them, just for everybody to look for a moment. Then we're going to come back here. All right, so the put spread that we're selling is the, that they have up there is a 104-102. It's got about a 64, 65% probability of success. What do we like to collect on a vertical spread? The extrinsic. We want to make sure that it's... We're always going to collect the extrinsic because we're selling something. We're always going to sell something out of the money, which means it's worth nothing if today was expiration. It's worth whatever it's trading for. A third of the width of the strikes. Perfect. Do you have a third here? Do we go from the price or the price? Or the two strikes that were... So you have a $2 wide put spread. You'd want to collect one third with the strikes, which is approximately... 75 cents. 65 cents. 66. Right. So do you get 66 cents here? Again, 51 there. So you got to move it up. So move up the put side. There you go. 64. Now you have 78 cents, correct? So that would work, right? That would work. Let's go down half a strike for a moment. Five and a half. There you go. And then three and a half. Five and a half. Five and a half, three and a half gives us 70 cents. Closest to one third. That's all I'm looking for. All right. So, and I'm running out of time and I do apologize. I want to throw a monkey wrench in this for you. Instead of just doing a short vertical spread, because Costco, you were bearish on, and the stock hasn't had a down tick. Yeah, since you put it on. Our hedge that we did is making all the money. You're directionally, you've been wrong for the last week. So I'm going to assume that you have that same type of mentality. So we're going to hedge up bet. I think you're ultimately going to be right in Costco. And I'm bearish on Costco. And I'm losing money in Costco. You're actually making money in Costco. So you're doing better than me. But our assumptions haven't been good on direction. So let's get smart and strategic. Let's put on a $1 wide call spread on top of this. Let's sell the 108109 call spread. It's not going to cost us any more buying power while you put that on if you could. If you want to go to the table view, you can make it easier for you. Okay. He's going to put in the 108109 call spread. So what we're doing here is we have $2 worth of risk. We collect 70 cents for argument 6. Our buying power reduction is going to be $130. By selling this call spread, since the stock can't close at expiration above the calls and below the puts, it has to close only at one price. You're not getting margined on both sides. So instead of having $130, you're collecting almost $102 here. Your buying power reduction would be $98. That would be a lot less. It would be a lot less. Probably getting to 108 is 35%. But you're collecting a dollar. So your break even is actually over 109. Go back to the curve view. You have no risk to the upside. And you're collecting another 30 cents. Makes sense? So it's still a bullish strategy. We don't make as much money to the upside. We have a smaller window. But we're going to have a chance to manage just at a 50% probability of success a little bit quicker. In my eyes. Okay. Sounds good. I'm running late. Let's just go over what we talked about here a little bit. We talked about market extremes. And how we quantify them. We looked at an iron condor that you did on Monday or Tuesday in your in your in your one of your original shows. And we did a skewed iron condor today. It's the same as an iron condor. It's just one side is wider. In this instance, we have a $2 wide put spread versus a $1 wide call spread, which makes it a little bit of a bullish strategy. We typically like to collect more than our risk on that one side, which is a dollar. Okay. All right. You got to try to get filled on this on this spread. Don't worry about stock keeps down taking. So you'll be fine. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. What do I normally say? Peace. Peace on the work.
