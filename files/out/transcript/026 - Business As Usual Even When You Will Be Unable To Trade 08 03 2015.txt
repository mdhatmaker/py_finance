 Thank you. What do I start? Bat vs. bat. How are you, son? Not too good today. My today column is not very, very green, so speak. That's the best answer that you've ever given me to an opening. Because my day always starts and ends with how the market is going. That's how I know what's going on. It's not if the market's going up or if the market's going down. It's whether my account is going up or my account is going down. So what you're saying is your account is going down today. A little bit. Feeling the heat a little bit. But it's okay. I think you've been here before. It's a character builder. It's a marathon, not a quick little race. I really haven't been here yet, though. That's the point. I've had two small winners, I would say. I mean, that's correct. You've only been doing this a month or less, right? Yeah. Okay. Net net your overall and your account. Your up, right? Yes. You're up about 150 bucks on the high end. I think you're up about 80 bucks total now or so. Yeah. And it's down $80 today or so. Let's take a look at your account real quick. You got the EUNES and P's down 1550. You got the Dow down almost 170 points. You can see how your wrist graph kind of changes real quick with 170 point down move or 15 point move in the EUNES and P's, right? Your overall beta weighted deltas are still relatively nothing, right? I mean, short six deltas is not what I consider, you know, long or short. But if you look at your wrist graph, you make a little bit more money to the upside. Now, put your cursor over the small red area there inside his wrist curve. Okay. Stop right there. So it looks like, let's just say the stock goes down a little bit more towards 205 or so. And that's the S&P 500. You'd be down around, it looks like about another, what does that say, about a hundred and a hundred bucks, let's say. Is that what it looks like? I can't say for me. Well, it's a thousand and then two thousand. So, I mean, just. Well, it should say on the right hand side there, I can't select the price 205 and you got about 150 to you down about 152 bucks, right? Mm-hmm. Is that correct? Yeah. Is that how you would that? Yeah. Okay. So, about the same type of area to the, to the upside, let's go to less, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I mean, keep going, yeah, yeah. Let's just, right, go up a little bit more, perfect, right there. And if you're there, you're up around 450 bucks. If it goes to 210. If it goes to 210, so, I mean, you've got SPY around in the middle, why I'm trying to show you is so, okay, so you have a portfolio that's basically neutral. If we stay right here, put your cursor right over the zero area, perfect. If you stay right here, you make back about $160. If we go up about $2, $3 at expiration, you make about $400, $500 in change. If we go down $2, $3, you lose about 150 bucks. That's trading. Mm-hmm. Like two of the three ways you're going to make money, that's trading. Not just like picking something to buy, picking something to sell and hoping to be directly right. Does that kind of make sense? Yeah. All right, cool. You've got a vacation coming. You're going to be off for the rest of the week, right, today's your last day of your week. I don't know, I'll be here holding down the fort. Make it true, I really think it's taken care of you. You're going to enjoy yourself being a son, have some fun. All right, so I want to talk about your account going on vacation and what to do. So, you're actually, in my eyes, going on vacation the perfect time, because there's 45 days left, 46 days left, till expiration. That's our sweet spot. So that means today for you, it's business as usual. And you actually have to get more than one trade on, because you're going to miss four days worth of trading. Does that make sense? Cool. All right, so I've got two trades for you to look at. Let's do them. All right. Okay, let's go to, first one I want to go to is let's go to Apple, AAPL. We can go to a chart of it too if you want to just take a quick look at it. I'm going to kind of go through these as quick as possible. Twitter is, will be the next one we'll look at. Okay, a year-to-date chart in Apple, it's down 10% over the last 10 days alone. More research has shown that when a stock has a move that's about 10% or more in a short period of time, which we think is around 10 days, we could be due for a little bit of a bounce. Okay, let's, with that in mind, Ivy Rank is 45, it was just above 50, not too long ago. Yeah, I saw it on the grid page when I was playing around earlier in the day. The stock was down about another dollar from here, so it's kind of come back a little bit when it comes back, volatility kind of contracts a little bit. But if you notice, like put a circle around the last time it had earnings, not the most recent, but the time back in April. Okay, so what I'm trying to show you is, put a circle down, I'm sorry, put it, you don't do, the tool isn't working. Okay, so if you look at the, in the bottom of the page there, I'm looking at the Ivy Rank, last time it had earnings, it was around a 50-some-odd percent Ivy Rank, and then it went quickly down to almost zero. Do you see the green line? Yeah, we're dropped. Okay, so now we go to where we just had earnings now. So it's around the same area, maybe a little bit less about 45 percent, quickly drops down to zero, and then we're back at like earnings level Ivy Rank. So I look at this as like an opportunity, an opportunity to sell premium in there. Makes sense? Yeah. All right, let's go to Apple, AAP, I will do it in Dobe, be fine. So what's your go, what would be your go-to strategy, your going on vacation? You have plenty of money in your account to use, what would be the strategy that you would use? High implied volatility, what do you going to do? Well, I mean, we're going to sell premiums, so we could sell a strangle on it, or something where we're selling premium, or I mean, since the Ivy R is on the lower end of the 50 scale, what about if we did like another, like, broken wing butterfly to the upside? So, broken wing butterfly to the upside, quantified it for me, what would be the way? Like, you know how we had, we did that in Netflix where we kind of had zero downside risk, what if we did that? Okay, so stop. If I have zero downside risk, like we did in Netflix, then that's actually the direction I want the stock to go. Does that make sense to you? Yeah. So if I did a broken wing call butterfly, or risk to the upside, like we did in Netflix, then it had to be neutral to bearish in Apple. Apple just had a 10% move down. I'm kind of neutral to bullish on it. So, if I want you to do a broken wing butterfly, then I would do it to the put side. I want to put the risk to the side. I think the stock is not going to go. Yeah, so it makes sense? Yeah, so if we did a pull, it would go, you know, we would have no risk to the upside if it goes past our... That's correct. That's correct. I don't hate that. But I'd rather just do a strangle for you right now if that's okay. Cool. Is that all right? Yeah. Okay. So let's skew it a little bit to the upside since you want... Since you... Seems like you want to be a little bit more bullish on it. Is that... Yeah. I mean, I'm trying to read you. We don't talk about this ahead of time, so I'm trying to read you. Yeah. Alright, so let's go to 45 days. It's fine. Let's go to one standard deviation, which would be my default go to click on go. So it looks like with 45, 46 days. Okay. So do you see something? Let's see. The stock is one. Let's just call it one 19. That's the 105 puts. That's 14 strikes lower. Are you following me so far? Yep. And we got 109 to 135. You're looking at... 17 there. 16 or 17 strikes higher. Look at the prices on them. You've got the call at 34 cents. You've got the put at 92 cents. That's... I'm not going to sell a call for 34 cents. Does that make sense? I mean, you're not getting a whole lot out of that. I don't think I am. So let's... The 105 put for 92 cents. Let's look at the 130 call. Let's go down five. Alright, so now you're about equal distance away. You got about 12 points, 11 and a half points to the upside. And it looks like you've got about 13 and a half points to the downside. But the prices are about equal. All I'm trying to do is like, you know, like, how much am I willing to risk for my reward? Okay. So we got $1.69. You've got about a 72 percent probably success. That's perfect for us, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. You want to skew it a little bit to the upside? Let's see if we move that put from the 105. Unfortunately, the five... You know, you got the five wide, so we'd have to go to the 110. We'd have to go to the 110 or a different month, a month with a weeklies in it. I'm going to prefer, and I think you should prefer, even in Apple, that has liquid weekly markets, meaning they're about six, seven cents wide, that we stay in the monthly that are basically one penny wide. Is that okay? Yeah. Okay. So we're going to give up some of the strike selections. So you've got the 110, 130, and it's trading for $2.37. Mm-hmm. I mean, I think if we're going to play for a bounce for the stock to increase, you know, let's go with the 110 and take the extra premium, and if we're thinking that it's going to go that direction, let's play that direction. Well, you just took off Costco strangle that you had on it. Yeah. You're going to use about the same amount of buying power that this is going to use. The Costco strangle was about the same amount of premium that you received in it, but the strikes were a lot tighter. I don't know. I think it's a good use of capital or return. Yeah. I agree. I think it's going to be $3.37 and you can change it later if you want to because I'm running out of a little bit of time. Cool. Let's go to Twitter. Let's go to a chart of it. Now, this is a stock that we've been long for some time. The knock-it-and-paid mefak again killed in it. Yeah. I mean, it hasn't stopped going down since it's like a wide run. Well, it's going sideways for a while, which has been kind of nice, but this moved down now. I mean, down 20% over the last 10 days, trading near all time lows for the stock. I don't know. Bells and whistles go off in my head that maybe we're due for a little bit of a bounce here. Now, you have a neutral, a slightly bullish portfolio. You just put on a neutral trade. I want to put on another little bit of a bullish trade here in Twitter. Are you okay with that? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So, relatively low-price stock. So what I'm going to trade is I'm going to try to give you all the little check marks that I'm looking at and then see if you can come up with, like, read my mind, what I'm thinking. So you've got decent implied volatility, 44%. If you look at the last time in that earnings and the time before I had earnings, the IV rank went down to around zero. Now the IV rank is 44%. Same thing that we saw in the Apple. Same thing that you saw in Apple. So we've got a relatively low-price stock. You've got a high volatility for the amount of time left. You got a stock that hasn't had an uptick. Let's go to a trade page of it, what type of strategy would you look for? Selling premium by premium. Selling premium. Selling premium. So what type of strategy would you look for? Well, I mean, we just did a strangle. So I mean, we could go to, like, a cover call, like we did on our FCX. So we're thinking exactly the same. Yeah. I think low-price stock, high implied volatility, covered call, or naked put. Same buying power, like we just, similar buying power. Similar buying power reduction. You could make more money with the covered call. You have a higher probability of success with the put. Makes sense? Yeah. Okay, you'll decide which one that you're going to do in Twitter. And if you're going to pick one, you're going to look at September, one strike out of the money on the call, and one or two strikes out of the money in the put. Making to collect around a dollar on the put. Okay. Makes sense? Yeah. Between, you know, 90 cents and about 50, something like that. I'll tweet that out after the show. Good. Good. Okay. Mm-hmm. Sound good? Yeah. Let's just take a quick recap on what we discussed today. So the first thing that we talked about was we just went over your overall account. And then we also looked at your own situation. Like, you're going on a vacation. Is the rest of my portfolio okay? Am I happy with everything I have? You also have a nice Netflix trade on that you might think about closing. You're about 60 bucks on it. Yeah. Again, it's, you have to go over your account that you have. And then take into consideration. You got 45 days left to expiration. That's the sweet spot. You're not going to touch these trades anyway for a week or two. So if you're going to be on vacation, what difference does it make? Yeah. Business is usual. Business is usual. Very good, son. Who comes up next? Tonight. What do I normally say? Peace. Peace.
