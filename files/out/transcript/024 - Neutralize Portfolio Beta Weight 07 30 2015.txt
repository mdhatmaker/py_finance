 We're back. Where do I start? Bat versus bat. How are you son? Doing well today. How are you? Very good. Why are you doing so well today? I was a little excited when during the new research segment this morning they did a new new month on a call. Which we placed yesterday. Correct. So that they validated what we were going through and one of their picks that they had on a previous show. I agree with you. I look at this kind of melancholy on that trade because they were getting in at a better price. Because the stock was down about 30 cents or so when they placed it. I think your accounts actually do not care. I think that new mountain mining trades only down small. Let's take a look if we could. Yeah. Okay. So you're down small. It looks like in new mountain mining. Okay. It's okay. Overall position is doing pretty good. You're up about $115 or so. You're down a couple bucks today about 30 bucks or something like that today. All right. You've got you've got an overall basically delta neutral position to be favor. Unclick. Click everything back on just so you can see all of his positions. Great. And close up the tighten up the window up. Thank you. Open up one more time. They go on the right hand side there. It shows you a beta weighted delta is your short two delta. I consider that extremely flat. Because you're extremely flat, let's look at that green curve there in your risk profile. You obviously make a little bit more money on a couple of your positions if we go a little bit higher. Okay. So yes, you're neutral. But you really got kind of a bullish stance a little bit. So I want to neutralize that a little bit. But you wanted to put on a trade. So I want to look at what you want to do because you found it. Yeah. We're, I mean, we're comparing the difference between just selling a naked put and doing the short call covered. Stock yesterday. And how they were like similar buying power. And so one of the things that I was looking at was just like where I would, you know, so many how it's so put in. And keeping with what we've been doing and just kind of like, you know, staying mechanical, I pulled up the grid and, and you know, searched through. For stocks with no earnings in the next 45 days. And so you used high volume, right? Because I usually use the notable list, which is fine. Yeah, I like to use the high volume. You can make your own list in here also. I mean, you can curate your own list. But okay, go ahead. Well, I mean, the notable stock list, those stocks also appear. Up here, if you use the high option volume, I mean, it just for me, it just gives me like a bigger group. It is, it is a larger amount of stocks. Yeah. Okay. Cool. And so the one that I was looking at was CNX, which is a toll energy mining. You know, group they are an energy sector. Okay. I've got a ton of gold positions, or not a ton, but I've done three gold positions so far. And I got a couple. What do you mean by three of an iron condor in GLD, right? Yeah. And we had the FCX position that we closed out. So that was our gold. So we've done three things in gold. So I figured I would do some some energy. And when we were actually looking at this, it was down 17 or 13 cents on the day. And it's been since I pulled it up. It's been moving up. But. Okay. So you got a high, high implied IV rank stock, 95%. Some I tight liquids, not a stock I trade all the time. Lower price stock, 16, $1,74. You want to sell and make it put. Stocks been beaten up. I remember correctly, it's been beaten up a lot, probably been cut in half the last year or so. So you want to catch what we call a falling knife, which is perfect. I mean, I like that. I mean, I can't buy the trend. I'd rather get it at a discount. That's the way that's the way I look at it. Yeah. Okay. So there you go. Yeah. So it's definitely been taken last year from 40 down to, you know, 16 or 17. Okay. Sounds great to me. Let's do it. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, let's go to 75% and see what happens. You want to do the 50 day of the September monthly. And you're just going to sell and make it put. Yeah. Okay. So in the advance column, you can, you can set it to a probability of being out of the money that you kind of want. So let's go to 75% and see what happens. You want to? Okay. Okay. Let's remove the weeklies too so that it goes. Perfect. Okay. Okay. To the closest monthly to 50 days, which is September, I think September is exactly 50. It won't click for some reason. All right. We'll just click go if we have to move it. It might not have any weeklies. I think that's the problem. Okay. It doesn't have any weeklies. So it won't let you click off the weeklies. All right. So that it brings up the 12 puts 36 cents. Is that seem like an acceptable credit to receive? No. I wanted to be in at 14. Okay. That was the one that I was looking at. Okay. It's been flipping in and out of liquidity. And you're talking about the little circle there or the little... Yeah. The range drop. The range drop. The little orange one. And so it's been kind of dropping out of liquidity. I mean, I figured, you know, if we put it on and it doesn't get filled, it doesn't get filled. So what's the only thing that you can control? Entry. Is your entry. So you know already that the markets are a little bit wide. Not extremely wide, but a little bit wide. I get it. Stocks are rallying up a little bit. So there's no reason why you have to put it in a mint price. You can put in any price you want. So why don't we go above the market? Let's click it up to around 74 cents. Okay. So now we'll put it in a 74 cents credit. So now we're going to have to move... Let's see. It's actually going to have to move about 23 cents or so for you to get filled. I'm just going to buy the delta of the option. Okay. Does that sound good? Yeah. Okay. Or volatility will expand a little bit. Stock goes a little bit lower, volatility expands a little bit. Okay. All right. All right. Beautiful. Let's push it through. Okay. That's just $1300 in buying power. It really only takes a couple hundred dollars in buying power. That's a fewer in an IRA type account. I'm told that color is fuchsia. I don't know what color I would call it, but they tell me that it's fuchsia and it's... Is it the yellow one? Yeah, I think so. I don't know. Isn't like fuchsia like a purple red something? I don't know. Okay. He told me it was fuchsia. Unless I'm lying. She was lying to me. It was a big cruel joke for four years. I don't know. She had the big box of crayons growing up. Yeah. The big box. The Batistas had the 10 pack, right? The red, blue, green, black. That was it. That's a joke. I'm not going to say it. All right. So I've got a... No, I know. Who's kidding? I had the 74 pack with the sharpener. I was going to say it with the sharpener. Yeah. It was so jealous of that. All right. So I have a trade fee. Okay. So going back to your overall risk graph, we had a little bit... We had more profit to the upside. That's really a butterfly that you have on. It's not fair to micro-manage your account when you have a limited amount of trades or five trades. All right. But let's go along with the whole scenario because we're building it, right? All right. I got a... We're at market extremes. Near highs. We've had a nice rally. I want to play the contrarian role again. I want to go into... I want to go into an ETF that's going to benefit from a down move, something like the spiders. Now, I want to... We can just... For the sake of saving time, because I know I'm going to go about seven minutes. Let's just go to the trade page in SPY. And just from this trade page, you tell me what you see. I mean, it's not too much on the screen. There's no option pricing. There's nothing else. I mean, it's low IVR. Perfect. Stop right there. So we can't use all of the strategies that you've already done so far. Because all of the strategies that you've done have been for... Hi, IVR. Okay....situations. So I've got a... I have something to interest you. Okay, I didn't want to go horizontal, meaning... Two different months, until I explained to you what a calendar spread is... And a diagonal spread is in a little more in depth. Maybe have some cards to support it. So I want to show you a trade in just one month... That's similar to a trade you did, a butterfly. But it's kind of what we call skewed. And you can skew a butterfly in many different ways. Do you remember what a butterfly is? Well, we did that. The one in Netflix, where we skewed. We still have it on. Yeah. And then we skewed it to the upside, where we had an embedded short call. To the downside, actually. We skewed it to the downside. So there was no risk to the downside. It was only to the upside. Past our longest strike. You were 100% correct. We did a... We bought a call spread that was a little bit closer to the money. Five dollars wide. And sold a ten dollar wide call spread. So we had no risk to the downside. But we wanted the stock to actually rally a little bit to 150. Yeah, but kind of staying that... That's very... We're saying that range. So the volatility contraction play, because you're selling and out of the money call spread. All right. If we have low implied volatility, there's not too many things we can do. Calendar spread, diagonal spread, or debit spread. Do you remember we talked about a debit spread a little bit? Do you remember? I wonder what we want to risk one to make one. Yeah. So I don't want to... We're buying, paying for it. Right. We don't want to pay anything, no extrinsic value over the price of the stock. All right. So let's go to... Do me a favor. Go to the table view for a moment. And then we'll come right back to the... To the curve view. Because the curve view kind of gives you the answers for a moment. All right. For the sake of time, because we only got a couple of minutes. Let's do what we always talk about. The stock is trading at around $211. So we always look to buy an option, one or two strikes in the money. And sell an option, one or two strikes out of the money. Let's go two dollars in the money to two thirteen. Let's buy the two thirteen put. You want to be on the downside, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. And let's sell an option that's one or two strikes out of the money. Let's go to the one or nine put. Okay. That spreads trading for... It looks like for about a dollar sixty in change. Do you see that? Mm-hmm. Okay. So what's your break even on this trade? Um, so it'll be a dollar sixteen... $1.63 is what you... $1.63. It's a four dollar wide spread. So it'll be a dollar sixty three less the two thirteen. I'm going to give you a quick little, quick little math thing that my teacher and PS207 shout out to public school 207 in Marine Park, Brooklyn. $4 spread. Like, like... I'm going to make Tom give you this test that we would give young guys that we were trying to. We asked one question that we were trying to hire. It's a four dollar spread. Don't make it crazy. If you were paying two dollars, your break even would be 9.11. Right? Two thirteen is to put your bank. Yes. If you were paying two dollars for it would be two eleven, right? Yes. Okay. So for paying two sixty or one sixty three then it's eleven... uh... eleven... 43. Two eleven forty three. No. Two eleven forty three. Here let's let the computer do it. Hit confirm and send one time. I have to send you to my school. So where's the break even? Two eleven thirty eight. Alright. Close enough. Close enough right there. What do you mean I'm... okay, I'm off. A nickel. Okay. It actually moved the penny off you. Yeah. But that's okay. Alright. So you were actually going to play four cents. It's good. It's good, it's good. Alright. It's like horse using hand grenades. Yeah. Okay. Alright. So the stock is trading at under two eleven and your break even is over two eleven. Two eleven thirty eight. Correct. Correct. So you're not paying any extrinsic value over the price of where the stock is trading at right now. Okay? Yeah. Okay. The my break even is above the current price. Correct. So let's get rid of that for a second and unclick that. Now let's... No. Let's have a screen. Perfect. Now let's sell another two oh nine put. Like not to finance what we're paying but let's sell another two oh nine put and buy a two oh seven put. So make you can either make that two or click on it. There you go. And let's buy a two oh seven put up on top. Perfect. So we're making a butterfly out of it kind of different. On your Netflix butterfly we had an embedded short call spread. In here we're actually buying a four dollar wide put spread and selling a two dollar wide's put spread. It brings our price down to a dollar eighteen from a dollar sixty something. So it's going to make our break even even further away from the stock price. Do you get that? Because now it's only the two thirteen minus the the one eighteen. Correct. Does that make sense? Yes. Are you okay with it so far? So what's our total risk on this trade? The total risk is what we're paying for it the one eighteen. Perfect. Awesome. What would be your possible profit on this trade? The one for the four dollar wide because that's the width of the of the largest side minus whatever we paid for it is the one eighteen. Perfect. Perfect. So the difference between the two. So if we paid one dollar for it our profit would be three. If we paid a dollar twenty for it our profit would be two eighty. Yeah. All right. Just try to teach you quick math. If you're too lazy to. Perfect. Perfect. Okay. Are you good so far? Yeah. Let's go to the curvy and take a look at this trade. Oh boy. Not a bad looking risk graph. It's still a fifty fifty shot. But the stock can go a little bit lower. It can go almost anywhere down. It can go anywhere. And we don't have any. Loss. Yeah. We don't have any risk to the downside. Perfect. Okay. Let's do this trade. Dollar seventeen. Let's just go in at the mid price and see what happens. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. You did good today, bud. All right. What do we say? Peace. Peace.
