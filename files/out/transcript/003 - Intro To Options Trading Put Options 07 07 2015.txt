 I'm good. I must have done something right. They let me back for a second episode. So listen, this is going to go on into into fruition. I mean, hopefully this is a couple of year process and you'll you'll grow from the very beginning, which you are right now. With the you know, some information that you've gotten from school, some information that you've probably got from friends, people here at tasty trade in and dough and what you'll learn in in real application. Placing trades. So we're going to start real slow. Yesterday we talked about we did calls. We did calls. And we wanted to get calls and puts a matter of fact, a slide that we showed at the end of the day showed, you know, calls by a call that's bullish. So I want to talk about puts today. And I want to also, you know, reiterate and go back to what we learned yesterday. So I made one more card for you today. Let's take a look at that. Because exactly what we talked about yesterday. It's more of the classic or clinical discussion on what we had buying a call bullish selling a call bearish today. We want to talk about buying a put, which would be bearish and selling a put, which would be bullish. Let's go to the dough platform and take a look at that's the card from yesterday. Very, very simple. We talked a little bit about what a call is. Do you remember what we talked about what a call is? Yeah, it's the right to buy. If you buy a call, it's the right to buy what? 100 shares of the stock. 100 shares of stock. Exactly. Exactly. And it's we're giving somebody else the option to buy those shares of stock from all set of predetermined price. Correct. It's exactly like what's it exactly like? Almost like a contract that you would have with your with your insurance company like for a car or something like that. Touchy subject with you because your car got stolen this weekend, which is a true story, right? You know, it's kind of funny. So you owned your car, right? Yes. But you gave you paid somebody. You paid somebody money to you got a contract back. And with that contract, they said that they would replace your car's value. If something bad were to happen to your car, now something bad did happen to your car. So that would be like buying a call. You have the right, but not the obligation to exercise that contract. Let's go to the dope platform for a second. We'll take a look at what we're talking about. And the last thing we were talking about Apple, this will be the homepage that you'll look at all the time when you see your own will click on the trade page. And we already filled in Apple, but you would have to fill in the Apple stock. You can put anyone you want. We were looking at a call that was trading around $100. And we had so much money we had to spend. We were bullish on the stock was your assumption. You always have to have an assumption calls are on the left. We were buying a hundred shares of we were buying a contract. You really weren't buying any stock. And our 135 strike price actually went up. So I wouldn't even be able to afford it today. Today you would not be able to afford it. Or if you bought it yesterday, you'd be making $5. Yeah. But that contract is the right to buy the stock at what price at the the strike that I'm buying it at at the 135 135. But your cost basis would be the today would be the 104 is what I'm paying today. So it would be $104 to buy that. Correct. But if you bought that option for $100 yesterday, let's just say for argument six, you bought it a dollar. Your break even price, your cost basis for Apple would be it would be the price of the strike price plus whatever I paid for it. So the if it was yesterday, it'd be $136 today. You know, 136 and 4 cents with the stock trading at 125. Yeah. But it only cost you $100 to control that contract control 100 shares of stock. One contract, one option contract. Controls 100 shares of stock. We discussed yesterday if you had a hundred or 125 dollars, you could buy one share of Apple. That's leverage. So you got calls on the left. Buy a call. I want the stock to go higher. You kind of jumped the gun a little bit. If I sell a call, you could argue that you want the stock to go lower and you would be correct. You also would argue that you have stayed the same. Well, you're selling premium just like your let's go back to your car example for a moment. You've been driving your 25 years old. So you've been driving for seven years. Let's just say for seven years you've been buying your own insurance. So for seven years, you've been buying that contract from the insurance company that you never exercised. So all those years of premiums that you paid, you never got to collect on. Now one bad thing happens and you get to collect on it. That's very similar to how options work, especially when you're buying an option that's out of the money stocks at 125. You're buying an option that doesn't make any money at expiration until the stock gets to over 136. That's a big move. Yeah. That being said, let's just talk about puts for a moment puts the mirror image the opposite of calls. So if I buy a call, that's bullish. If I buy a put, is that going to be bullish or bearish? That's going to be bearish. Exactly. Because you're ensuring yourself in case this, this stock goes up. In case it goes down, if I buy a put, let's just talk about buying for a moment, because I think when you're a new trader, it's it's easier to grasp the buy side. If I buy a call, I want the stock to go up. If I buy a put, I want the stock to go down. Now, a lot of individuals, millennials and my mom, who's in our 80s, doesn't understand that you could buy something and still benefit by going lower. That's why everybody who invests in the market or your own daughter, my own daughter, your sister, who first got a first 401k was like, okay, so what do I invest in that's going to go up? Market has two sides. You can even argue it has three sides. It can go up, down, or stay sideways. There's ways to benefit in all market conditions. That's what we're going to try to learn over the next year or two that it takes us. But let's talk about puts for a second. So if we're going to buy a put and we had that same $100 on the dough platform, the puts are on the right hand side. What put would you be able to buy or closest to buy? The 110 would be the closest to the neck. The 110 looks like it's trading for around was at 54. The next one's at 111 so that'd be too expensive. The 115 is at 111. The 115 is at 111. We'll take the liberty of being able to round that you have 110 dollars or 112 dollars to buy that. So you'd be able to buy the right to benefit if the stock goes below what price at expiration? Well, if I'm paying the 111 for it, so if it goes below the 114 or 113.89, then I would be covered. Exactly. You're covered down to and then have no risk below 113.89. Let's just say you paid a dollar for it. 114.10 and below, you would have no risk. Now, at first thought, the stocks 125, if I wanted to benefit from a down move in the stock, I can invest as a little as $100 and benefit from the stock going lower. So the call we benefited from the stock going higher, the put we benefited from the stock going lower. Buy a call I want the stock to go. So think about it. Like with your own type of contract, you could buy both those contracts spend $200 and if the stock goes a lot higher, you benefit. How do you lose? It stays where it is stays exactly where it's because there's time premium. How much time premium are you buying? What's the expiration to August? How many days? To August. It looks like it's 21 of 45 days to August. So when you buy that option, you're buying that option that contract for 45 days. All right. So let's wrap it up for a quick moment here. What did we learn from yesterday? When you're buying a call, you're buying a call options, the contract that gives you the right, but not the obligation to buy a stock at a specific price within a specific time frame. That time frame that we discussed today was 45 days, the price that we talked about on the call was 135. The put is the mirror opposite. The put allows you to benefit when the stock goes lower, meaning you get to benefit as the stock goes lower, you can benefit from a market on both sides higher or lower. So tomorrow we'll talk about how much it would cost you to sell those options. All right. Sounds good. What do we normally say after this? We always say who's coming up next? Tim Knight is coming up next. Peace. Peace.
