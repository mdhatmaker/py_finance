 I Nikki when I start that versus that me and you you and me how's it going good good hectic day out there Right it has been hectic though Netflix split has been all there's been a lot of support questions coming in for that So we've been busy with that, but yeah, it has been a hectic day here So those who don't know you also do support when you're not this 15 minutes of fame that you have doing live Internet TV Pretty cool. Yeah, yeah, I'm on the chats the live chats through Tasty Trade though Also doing emails to the small the support desk and call-ins a little bit of everything so beautiful It's what startup does everybody does a little bit of everything. Yeah, do you ever see me empty out the dishwasher? No definitely not yet. I haven't done it a long time I'm just kidding Used to do it all the time. We first started Okay, so how are bonds doing today? Up a what a buck 30 right now buck 40 up like that point and 11 One 11 tips however you want to phrase it you could say you were right Nick You take me to tweet this morning. I was that Was like oh yeah, I was down about a half a point this morning, which is a large move a point and a half the other direction Is a even larger move, but yes this morning the bonds were down Half a half a point and they tweeted out that you had your mother's market awareness, which was much Well, no, but they were up Then and now we could put up if you want to if you want to put up a chart of I don't put up a chart of TLT since we're not gonna be trading Futures in your account for quite some time. Let's just take a look at a chart of TLT So you can't get any tighter than that right? Yeah, that's just one day So that is one day. Yeah, it's one day. Oh good. I didn't see the left side So that one little that one little tiny red spot at the beginning is the one you were talking about Yeah, the people who help us didn't put the box there in a timely fashion otherwise it would have gotten that right Yeah, so that's the one day chart. So yeah, so they were lower they've rallied and Did you sell a vertical spread? I did not were you gonna sell a vertical call or put spread put spread Push for because you were bullish on the product. All right cool. So yesterday Didn't allow you to sell a call spread or get or put spread or or get to because we hadn't discussed what it is So I like to discuss what a vertical spread is and then we'll find something to do Let's just take a quick little recap on what your position is right now Why don't we since we have that screen up there? We can go to your screen later on Nick when we go to make a trade But let's just go to your portfolio That is your full portfolio. You're short a Costco 145 call and you're short a Costco 135 put and it looks like you're up about Today you're up about $14 and change on the overall trade I think you're up around 20 some of ours is hard for me to see on the on the overall trade. Okay Let's see. Where's the call trading at what price? Isn't the whole thing the extrinsic extrinsic value to get it close up that yeah close up. No, no you can There we go You know go to the upper right there and make it Yes, thanks click on it. All right. So you got $265 in extrinsic value you sold the call at 217 I think you sold to put it 70 cents 60 69 69 cents you got two eight six and it's trading for $265 So you've got yourself 21 bucks in profit not bad with the stock not going in the direction you want yet Still have a high probability of trade anything over 50 50 we consider high probability trade You're probably a profit on this overall trade is 62 bucks. What has helped you on on this overall trade Let's go to let's just go to the trade page and click on Costco Do you remember what the ivy rank was in Costco when you put on your first trade ever? It's like 52 or 53 somewhere around 100% correct and right now it looks like that's 43 So volatility is contracted by 10% and the stock still hasn't gone your way when you sold that call Just to show you what a decaying assets like Give it to the arrow for a minute go to the table for for a second and let's take a look at what that Trade kit out of July and go down to August Okay, so the call that you sold was the 145 call if you can draw an arrow to it It's 197 208 right now you sold that call at a mid price of two dollars and 17 cents with the stock about a dollar lower It was about a week ago Monday. I believe it was a trade to make sure I'm Monday Friday Friday blessed So we made the trade on Monday was the put that was money was put there we so the put we sold with the stock higher than where it is Now so stocks gone lower the puts lost money But the stocks gone higher the calls lost money. That's a perfect storm for us Now we want the stocks just to kind of sit here Contract a little bit and we set a reasonable expectation of about a dollar a little bit over a dollar over a dollar our original credit Received 50% of our original credit received 217 around a dollar dollar five dollar eight dollar ten anywhere in there 95 cents anywhere in there is it would be an acceptable Place to close it. Let me give you one more little secret or a little bit of trade hack or something like that That should typically happen on average in about 20 days after you put on the trade if you're placing these trades around 45 days to expiration that's just the way the numbers work out if it works out it's about 20 days from now Is that just a general ruler is that based on? It's not a guy it's it's based it's based on on research that we've done here a tasty trade and there's a bunch of market measures on it You certainly could send an email to Research at tasty trade.com and they'll give you a you know a couple of segments for you to check out and you should do that yourself too So at least you have the numbers behind it. I mean, I know you're gonna take my word for it because I'm your father But you know somebody else out there might not you know believes I say the truth all the time all right so Emanuele S&P is done four dollars and 50 cents this becomes a part of market awareness Do you know what the Emanuele S&P's? That's the S&P 500. That's what would all fun managers or like like like like When I was a kid people would say what's the Dow doing? No way would said like what are what's the S&P 500 doing? As the market matured everything became you know, what's the market doing? They still quote the Dow they still talk about the Dow But anybody in the business or in the know who or anybody who does their own investing They always want to know what the S&P 500 is doing because 500 stocks 500 most capitalized stocks is a better indication of what the overall market is doing than a select 30 And then having the or the the big wide range of of everything Now, you know that that would skew it more than than the 500 top 100% it's you know so funny because Everything we talk about is how We need number of occurrences S&P 500 versus the Dow 30 so you want when you're trading you want a number of occurrences You want to put on as many trades you can to have a flatter skew meaning You know one goes higher one goes a little bit lower and everything kind of you hope everything kind of works out for itself All right, so you've got one trade on so that's like Micro managing a position meaning you know, I'm gonna put on one thing I'm gonna find the best trade and I'm a sit and watch or they like you could drive yourself nuts because you were doing that right I got the itch right now I'm like oh gotta put on a couple more. This is that's exactly what you said to me Yesterday when we're on the show you were talking about like let's do a vertical spread what haven't even told you what a vertical spread is or at least I know you're working here at tasty trade And I know everybody out there who's watching this has watched other segments So they know what a vertical spread is but it's always good to go back to the basics And let me give you the setup for what we want for a vertical spread so let's go Let's go into do we use we use a screen that we have up there and then we'll get to your Screen for you to place the trade Let's just go into the just because they can draw the arrows on here. It's a little bit easier for me. Yeah, let's get out of this and go to The the tiles on the left hand side called the grid And this is what I do every day. I'm looking for a trade. I'm looking to sell sell the first thing I want to do is sell Valtili so I'm looking for high implied volatility so click on the funnel Get rid of all the excluding earnings Let's go to 37 days to expiration You can do zero to you can do 50 to 100 first if you want to it doesn't matter me So we're looking for an IV rank around 50 to 100 and then change that from zero to 120 down to 37 now you have it right already Otherwise zero to 37 for the earnings because we want to take those out of our range because we don't we don't want the earnings to occur Before that expiration or right on the expiration could have said better myself and then click off of that and We don't have a big and if you remember on Friday we had about Three or four rows of stocks to pick from today. We only have five. So what does that tell you volatility is doing? It's probably going lower. I mean, there's not a lot of stocks that have high volatility Perfect it's contracting. I just want to make sure that you get it. I'm messing the same question That's what make sure that you're getting it. I see the same question in a different way Okay, so of all the stocks up there for reasons that we'll go into it another day Greek the first one FXC and Asher. I'm gonna throw them out Greek is a is a ten-dollar stock markets are a little bit wide in there. I don't have a problem with you Trading that stock, but I'm a little bit of a of a bull on a dip Meaning that I want to buy that stock As the stock is going lower, we call that buying into weakness. I like to buy something when it's going a little bit lower I like to sell something when it's going a little bit lower previously I like to sell something when it's had a more momentum move or going a little bit higher I like to sell into strength, so I like to sell something when it's going a little But higher I like to buy into weakness I like to buy something when it's going a little bit lower Why I think I'm getting it in a discount, and I think I'm selling it to the premium I don't know if it's going to go higher or lower, but that's just my thinking. Always in a contrarian role. And I hope that you developed that same type of style. Okay. Next thing that we have up there is TLT. Now TLT are bonds that's what you want to trade yesterday. If we're looking for high implied volatility, everything being relative, that's the highest most, highest implied volatility, most liquid product that we have on the board. So we should have a position in there. Now, let's hold on a minute. If you look at the tile, it says it's up $1.36. It's a big movement today. Big movement up. So I must owe you some money because you want to sell a put spread in there. So you did good. Okay. So now what are we going to do? Since we've had a big move up of around 1%, a little over 1% on the stock, let's look at selling a put spread like you wanted to, which is a bullish strategy. And since the stock's ran up already, let's sell a call spread too. Also, together, it's called an iron condor. It's two vertical spreads of vertical spread and a credit spread are exactly the same thing. It's like saying six of one, half dozen of another. Vertical spread, credit spread, same exact thing. Makes sense? Makes sense. Debate spread is buying the spread. Credit spread is selling the spread. We're going to sell two vertical credit spreads. We're going to sell a call spread and we're going to sell a put spread. We're going to make the same type of risk graph that you have in Costco. We're going to do it all with one click and we're going to use a lot less buying power. Okay. Let's get off of this screen for a moment and let's get to your own screen and put in TLT for me. So we forget about Costco for now. We leave that on. We already know how we're going to get out of the trade. You can certainly go there and do you have something in there, right? What is that? Hold on. What do you got? That was just so clear it on the right hand side dish. Should everybody do that? Okay. Beautiful. So Do does a great job of setting us up at a one standard deviation. Let me let me let's show you what Do does and then let's see how we can modify it to fit our own entry criteria. Remember the only thing that we can control is entry. So that's number of contracts and what strategy we pick. We're picking a high implied volatility stock, high IV rank. So that means we're selling premium. Let's go and click on strategy for me. And then we're going to go down to iron condor. Now, before you click on anything else, look at what the box does right in there. It shows you a risk graph of the strategy that you're going to do. Like if you didn't have somebody talking to you and telling you what an iron condor is, if you looked at that risk graph, you're selling a call selling a put that's closer at the money and you're buying a call and buying a put that's further out of the money to define your risk. Okay. So we want to do a normal iron condor. That's the top one. Go to your advanced settings for a moment. Okay. So expiration 15 days. Let's hour optimal time to get into a trade. 45. So let's put 45 in there and see what happens. Do we like to trade weekly options or monthly options? Monthly is what we prefer. So get rid of the weeklies. You don't have to have that on there now. If you want to do a weekly trade someday, we'll look at it. Click on one standard deviation. Okay. Well, with the strikes. Now here, this is an interesting thing about an iron condor as opposed to a vertical spread. And I would have loved to have done a vertical spread today, but markets just don't permit us to do that. Meaning you were bullish on the spread the time you were bullish on the stock. The time to do it was yesterday when you wanted to. That doesn't make sense to do that. Same. Well, I don't know if it's going to go higher, but it just had a 1% move. It's not the type of product that has that large of a move typically. Although it's been very volatile lately. So maybe we'll just play the movement back and forth. Okay. Total widths. So if I'm risking, if I define your maximum risk, because you see how it says it on the right hand side. So if I went $1 wide, I have $100 worth of risk. If I did a $2 wide, I have $2 worth of risk. $5 wide, I did a $5 worth of risk. How wide do you want to go? I mean, it depends on what kind of credit I'm getting is how I would. Okay. So as a new trader, that's a pretty good answer. And it's a fair answer, and it's not a wrong answer. I'll give you what we've, I've given you what we found so that you have good rules or at least good guidelines, $3. $3 wide iron condors with around 45 days to go to expiration seems to be the best risk reward from our research. So let's start with $3. All right. $3. And click go. Okay. So brought you to August with 37 days, which is perfect. It's got you see those two white lines there right about where your two short strikes are. That's a one standard deviation move. 85% of the time, the stock stays inside that one standard, excuse me, around 75% of the time, the stock stays inside. That's really 68%. 68% of the time, the stock stays inside that one standard deviation range. What's your credit received? 56 cents. 56 dollars. Okay. So we have a little bit of a rule here. We like to collect around one third of the width of the strikes. Okay. So one third of the width of a $3 wide strike would be around $1. So let's tighten up our widths. Okay. Now stop for a moment. You've got about $1. About one third of the width of the strikes. Look at the prices on the call that you're selling. 66 cents. And look at the price of the put that you're selling. A dollar two. Do you see that? Yeah. Now they're both about, well let's see, 17 and a half to 22. You're about five down. You're a little bit closer on the put side, correct? Make sense? Let's just take that put side down a little bit and then move the call side down a little bit. So just stay right there. The strikes, all the widths to the left. Well, that way. Thanks. Okay, perfect. So now we went from a one standard deviation range. Now we moved it into kind of almost equal. Does it make sense? You're trading for around the same price that you call is trading for. It's still $3 wide. You're getting around that $0.90. Let's route this one time at $0.89. You're probably going to have to move it by a penny or two to get filled. But we'll leave it right now the way it is. Okay. Let's try to review a little bit about what we talked about today. And tomorrow I'll go over more of what an iron condor is and all of the benefits of why you should do a condor possibly over the directional. The directional aspect of a vertical spread. I'd say the trade that you put on had a had a 58% probability of success. We can say that a high probability trade because it's anything over 50%. A vertical spread is a simultaneous purchase and sale of two options. Same type, same expiration dates, but different strike prices. Same type meaning both calls or both puts. In your case, you did two vertical spreads. You did two vertical credit spreads at the same time to make an iron condor. You okay? You're fine with it? Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. Who comes up next? Tonight. A rerun of 10, right? We're on for the seven times. We're going live? Oh, last call. Oh, yeah. Never mind. Last call. I'm still on duty. Too nice back tomorrow. Peace. Yeah.
