 I Mickey, where do I start that versus bat? You know, I didn't realize something every time we start this show There's this like big hands of picture of just you. I know How'd you work that out? Well, we got some pictures together coming soon. I think okay. All right good Well, gotta shoot a spotlight with me a little bit, right? Yeah. All right, so As we do every day After my show is over at 11 o'clock We do a show in the morning from 7 to 11 Tom Sazofa myself We have a little lunch and then you kind of come buzzing around and What do you always ask me? I give you the kind of the nudges like hey, hey, come on. What's plan? What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do and what I get I have the itch now So I got it you've been bit. Yeah, and since you're on for the first five hours I got to sit up and look at my portfolio page the whole time I can't put anything on I got weight I got weight so okay, I can understand that so let me backtrack for a moment Do you know how long it took me to make my first trade? Three years Why was that for three years? I worked at a job just like you're doing and Then saved enough money to open up a trading account saved enough money To buy a seat on the floor of the exchange Which actually somebody lent me the money to and up until that moment all I could do was paper trade like fake trade So you've been at this this is gonna be this is the first full week, right? I mean of actual trades. I think we made a first day on Monday we did last week Friday Friday the week prior but Friday the week last last last week was our first trading for a week Yeah, sometimes you just got to pump the brakes a little bit and Understand some of the products. So what you did to me today was you came up to me said You know what there's not a lot to trade you have a lot more technology than I ever had like I was Subjected just a few stocks that I that I was able to trade on the floor of the CBOE you have access to everything And I know you go through the dough platform and you you go to the high and volatility You want to do that for me if you if you don't mind Nikki you don't have to do it with the other screen for a moment and you go through the high implied volatility Just like they're doing on the screen. They're hitting the grid going up to the The funnel there in the in the middle of the page Changing it you know to high implied volatility and coming up with a bunch of stocks and a bunch of stock really only only comes out to be about Five or six by the time you've done it don't have earnings and you're setting all your parameters that you want So you said to me how about we go to volatility. Let's take a look at volatility you can take that screen down and I said I thought to myself okay It's probably one of the hardest things to understand But if you can understand it from the very beginning from a really high level a conceptual level Then it just becomes any other product just like everything else. Tom always has this saying like you know, do you want like the practical Application of something and learn how to trade it or do you want to have a sausage is made? Redden rather know how it's made and just okay now Okay, so I'm a little bit of the I'm a little bit different like I if somebody told me and I believe what they were saying that this is the way to do something I don't really care like like so what is volatility? What's it made up of? I don't think you really care. Do you do not I'm trying to say like like um you came up to me and said let's trade Vxx vxx. Okay. What is Vxx? It's very hard to understand is definitely okay, so you're one you want we get to trade yeah and you want to trade something You don't understand because you're anxious and you like what you see and we've we've discussed volatility and how it's been low currently and you know Just as in an intuition, you know, I thought okay well if it's hard to find stocks that are in our Criteria, why don't we go for volatility which we identify that is low? You're your spot on what you're thinking and I 100% agree with you and I think it's what we should do otherwise It would be having this discussion with you today But the first thing I said to you before you made your first trade was what do you need if you're gonna be a successful trader? Do you remember? The one thing I think that confidence confidence How can you have confidence in something that you don't know what it is like you don't understand what it is Does it does it make sense? Yeah, all right, so I'm gonna put up let's put up one slide for you and we'll go through the products The volatility products that I think you should learn about and how to trade so the first one that we're gonna come up here With and it'll pop up there is Vxx Now Vxx it says this and these are just my little Shorten version of of what everything is not like how the sausage is made but in practical application Vxx with a stock that you want to trade I put up their first. It's exposure to the S&P 500 VIX short-term futures I don't think you know what the VIX short-term futures are right no, okay great that's good You're not supposed to you get brand new at the next one is UVxy That's an ultra fund ultra just means that it's a multiple typically two or three times the movement So it's kind of like two or three times the movement two times in this exam example UVxy of Vxx those short-term futures index again The third product that we trade is the VIX itself and that's VIX the symbols to each one is Vxx UVxy and VIX there are other products, but these are the three most liquid. These are three that I trade all the time Okay, the VIX is quoted in percentages and translates roughly to the expected move of the S&P 500 now of all of them Maybe I'm this speaking for a moment. Well you tell me of all of them. Which one has Which one seems more familiar to you? I mean the VIX would be the most familiar because I'm familiar with the S&P 500 so I would imagine that's From what I read about the X-AX it was You know VIX was the S&P 500 and then VXS Vxx was You know some kind of measure of that volatility. Okay, so I okay Again, how the sausage is made doesn't really matter to me But if we can understand the VIX VIX we probably can get to Vxx and then probably UVxy Anytime you see something that's like a two or three time multiple think about it How do they create a product that can move two or three times something? I mean, it's not it's not voodoo economics. They have to use something that has a lot more risk So as you get more of a multiplier the more risk you have that doesn't mean that's a bad thing It just means you have to understand the risk so you can have the confidence to make the trade So the first one that we should go into is VIX if we were gonna look to make a trade now now VIX is a real funny all Volatility is kind of a real funny product. I'm gonna save you making the trade until tomorrow because Vxx and you can take that down for a moment Vxx is quoted off of forward slash Vx Now I think you're gonna have to put up the toss platform because the Doe platform doesn't support You can just go in forward slash VX is fine So that VIX product we're gonna get to in a moment is Price off of this product Now I want to go into this tomorrow and not today because if you notice it re-what it says up there CBOE Volatility index VIX the futures and what does it say July? July okay July futures are expiring Mean they're done after today. Yeah, so what we're gonna look at on Tomorrow on the VX futures is going to be August now if you put in forward slash VX Q5 Tomorrow this will be What VIX is priced off of it's what it's priced off of today also? We'll get to the moment's what it's priced off of today, but you know, it's the prices around 14 and a half 14 dollars and 43 cents All right, let's go let's go to Doe for a moment and remember that price of 14 and a half and put in VIX for a moment Sure they could make this trade today. I just think it's it's a Easier conversation for you if we make it tomorrow and and so you can explain it go to the table perfect and stay in August Okay, um On the dough platform just like the toss platform and Again, this is why volatility products are so I mean you just learned about calls and puts and iron condors and Strangles and now you're getting into a product that's Where's VIX trading at? um $12.70 cents right so so Where would on the if you were looking at this was any other stock where would you be looking for like what's the first strike in the money? 12.5 right the 12 and a half strike Perfect answer, but remember what I told you a moment ago think about where those VIX futures are trading at the 14 14 and a half The first strike in the money here is really 14 and a half Because it's in August if you can put a a triangular or rectangle around the August month Because these are August The IX options priced off of the August futures, okay Does that make sense not at all? Okay get out of August So and go to July okay stop for a moment Remember we were talking about the July futures a moment ago, which are trading right around $12.80 The computer's correct that showing you the 12 and a half call as the first strike in the money Since the computer is looking at the July Pass it has one day left so exactly exactly so tomorrow This will be a lot cleaner. I want to have this discussion with you today so you can see this this difference between when the When the futures expire so you can see which ones in the money tomorrow go back to August There'll be no more July options August will be there and this price won't be 1270 anymore. It'll be somewhere near 14 bucks Okay, okay, so the so because of the futures because the futures so can I give you a can I give you a Like I almost like a trade hack Okay, if you look at the the call and the put that's closest to the same price That's the at the money option in almost any product that you look at you notice how the puts a dollar $25 a dollar 30 the call is one 15 120 that's the at the money option If you look at the 12 and a half call think about it for a moment. How can the 12 you know everything is time and price How can something that has 28 days Have basically no premium at the 12 and a half line Do you know what I'm saying like the call is two dollars and 20 cents and the put is 20 cents doesn't make sense Does that make yeah Okay, so if you were going to to be bullish on volatility and you wanted to Buy a call spread in August today. What would you do? I Mean you have to go to the 14 and a half strike price you couldn't do it at the 12 and a half now So we like to buy one strike or two strikes with three strikes in the money and sell one strike two strikes with three strikes out of the money So if I was looking to buy and at the money call spread here with a 50 50 shot I might look at something like you know the 13 16 call spread or the 14 15 call spread depending on how much risk I want to put on does that make sense yeah, okay, so so let's Let's review what we will have about a minute and a half left. Let's review what we what we spoke about a little bit here What we talked all about was volatility products We talked about three and really from a high level Vxx UVxy and Vxx I want you to watch this show over again because this is really a it's a it's not a difficult subject, but it has some It has some differences compared to other equity products That's why you have to understand it so you can have the confidence to make the trade Before you actually make the trade I'm going to give you one little trade hack And this is something we talk about all the time a 19% implied volatility equals a 1% Daily move So if volatility right now is about 15% That's what in August futures are saying And The e-mini s and p's are 2100 if they move 20 points they're moving more Then they're implied volatility so a normal move should be somewhere around that 12 or 13 Point move which we're having today. Yeah, today so today so today at its implied volatility It's a normal move. Yes, it's been in one direction because it'd be 13 up or 13 down But it's about what the implied volatility says if we move 20 then we're moving outside of that implied volatility 19% implied volatility equals a 1% daily move now you have some sort of Concept on on reasonable expectations for how much a product should move All right cool. All right good job, but you tomorrow you make it trade your first trade in VIX Who comes up next tonight? What do I normally say peace peace?
