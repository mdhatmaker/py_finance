 I'm here to play the song. Make it right back. Where do I start? Bat vs. bat. How are you? All right today. All right today. What does that mean? I'm hurting a little bit today. Netflix, that Netflix position, the butterfly that we have on is... Going past your short strike. You had a broken wing butterfly on, right? Yes. $5 wide call spread. You were long by a $10 wide call spread. The stock was actually below your long strike shortly after we put it on. And now it's had basically a extremely large move, a standard deviation or more, move to the upside. And now it's today with it being up $4. It has gone over your break even. So what do you do with that trade? Eight days to go. I don't know. I mean, how do we manage that? We have a defined on entry. We have a defined risk trade. Broken wing butterfly. You were looking to make about $2.50 to risk about $500, $250 versus $5, with about a 70% probability of not......with a 70% probability of risking $1, excuse me, risking $2 to make $1, with a 70% probability of success. And now the stock has gone further. You said the fine risk trade is really another thing. Up until... No, up until today, you were right at your break even. On a large one standard deviation move, stock happens to be up $4 today. It could easily have been down $4. Makes sense? Yeah. So we said... Okay. Good morning. Colt, 50 cent debit, so it was a 50% profit on it. Right. It was a iron condor. 103.103.103.105.105.108.109. So it was a $2.00 wide put spread by a $1.00 wide call spread. Mm-hmm. Stock was in the middle. We sold the $2.00 wide put spread and the $1.00 call spread for a total of $1.00. So we had no risk to the upside. Stocks in the middle of your short strikes, exactly what you wanted. Like you said, an iron condor, you want the stock to be in between your short strikes. We closed everything at around 50%. You had a 50% profit and you closed it. Like that. Very good. All right. So yesterday, when on the clothes, when we were done talking, we talked about synthetic stock yesterday. And on the clothes, they were like, well, I'll have to go over that again. And we never went over it. So I made a slide for you. It's not a test because the answers are going to be there for you, but I'd like to just go over with you. So you have it clear so everybody else has it clear. And then we can make move on to a new trade today, also using synthetic stock. Cool. So let's understand this so that we can move on to the next trade. All right. So the stock is at $57. We were talking about City Group yesterday, but it could be any stock. Just the stock is at $57. Let's think about the counter party for a minute. So you're the counter party. You're the other side, the person who's going to take the other side of your trade. Okay. So you sell, somebody else goes and then buy because you wanted to buy yesterday, the 50 call. So you sell the 50 call at $7.10. The delta on the screen was about 100. So it's definitely stock substitution. You sold a call. Are you long or short? For short. So you go in and buy 100 shares of stock at $57. Did you lock in a 10 cent profit? Did you lose 10 cents or there's no way to tell? I mean, it's too early to tell at this point. Why? Because if the stock moves the value of the short optional change. Where do you have risk on that trade? Because you're right, but I don't think you got it yet. You have risk to... You have risk to the downside. Perfect. You sold the call. You got your short, your bot stock. You're going to be even down to $50 actually. $59.90. You're going to start losing money. Yeah, because that's the 10 cents I got over the... Exactly. Intrinsic. Yeah. Ten cents over parity. You see, so you have it. You understand it. You got it. So you have no risk to the upside on that trade. Stock can go anywhere and you would lock in a 10 cent profit. Stock anywhere above $50 and you have a 10 cent profit. Okay, so the only way to tell, please go to the next slide. The only way to tell is what the put is trading. The $57 put is trading at 20 cents at that moment. Remember, it's trading between 20 and 23 cents. I just rounded to 20 cents. If you had to, if you were the other counter-party, you sold that call for $7.10. Your risk is below $50. That should actually say the $50 put. I apologize. We have changed that for me and the archives. The $50 put is trading for $0.20. So I've got to go out and buy that put for $0.20. I'm locking in a 10 cent loss. So the fair value for that call that we were trying to buy, yesterday, was $7.20. Now nobody's going to sell it to you at $7.20. But they might sell it to you at $7.21 or $22 or $23. Does that make sense? Yeah. Forgetting about any type of dividend or anything like that. That's just pure, like if you're looking at a wide market and you're trying to figure out what fair value of an option is, all you've got to do is take a look at the stock, the call price and the put price, add the two of them together, and you get the fair value of the option. It makes sense. All right, awesome. Fantastic. Somebody wrote me an email. So every time we say make sense, they would take a shot. They'll be drunk within seven minutes of the show. Yeah. They won't make it to the close. They won't make it to the close for sure. And that makes sense, right? Yeah, that makes sense. You're going to get them drunk. All right. So let's talk about, I want to go to a low stock. High implied volatility. Over a 10% down would move. We always look for a little bit of reversion to the mean and price and volatility on that type of move down in 10 days. Let's go to a chart of USO. Awesome. Stocks trading 1408 right now. That's my fault I should have had that for you. That's two mistakes I made. The slide, the 57-foot was my mistake. Nobody else's. And that doing that was my mistake, too, I apologize. Stocks trading 1408. It's down 12.5% over the last 10 days. It's certainly been getting killed. There's no doubt about that. 57% IV rank. IV rank's been as high as 100 in here about, you know, three, four, five months ago. But markets move, things change. I've got to take advantage of what I have right now. You've got low implied volatility basically everywhere. Here I have low price, high implied volatility. What type of strategy would you look at? I mean, if you wanted to sell premium. Selling premium. Selling premium. Selling premiums. Covered call, low stock, low price. Yes. Stock. Covered call is good. Naked put is okay also. I want to keep the whole theme of a synthetic stock. So let's take a look at something. Let's go into go. And at the money put, if I sell it, how much delta does it have? Zero. At the money put, if I remember the 50 call that you were buying yesterday in city group, that had 100 delta because it was deep in the money. Any, forget about what's up there on the screen. Any in the screen is right. But any option that's at the money has a 50 delta. Delta is just directional risk. It's a 50% chance it's going to be in the money. It's a 50% chance it's going to be out of the money. That's delta. Does that make sense? Yes. So every put that's at the money is going to have a 50 delta. Every call that's at the money is going to have a 50 delta. So let me ask you something about synthetic stock for a moment. You with me? Yep. If I buy a call, I'm long how many, if I buy an at the money call, I'm long how many delta's? 50. If I sell a put, am I long or short more delta's? You're short 50. So you'd be... If I sell a put, if you're... I'll do the other way. If I sell a put, is that a bullish or bearish strategy? Bullish. Okay. So if I sell a put, am I long or short delta's? You'd be long delta's. Fantastic. If I sell the at the money put, I'm long how many delta's? 50. If I buy the call, that's at the money. So you're long 50 there too. So you're long 100 together. Synthetic stock. Okay. Okay. Because it's essentially the same as buying the stock there. Same exact thing as the example that we used in city group. Just using a deep in the money option. For pricing purposes. Okay. So if I sold two puts that are at the money, I'd have approximately how many delta's? Long. Long or short. Long. Perfect. Synthetic stock. Long call, short put. Synthetic stock. Long in the money call. Synthetic stock. Two puts that are at the money. Synthetic stock. Got it? Yeah. Okay. So let's sell two at the money puts or just out of the money. The stock is 1407. We're going to sell the 14 puts. Technically speaking, it's out of the money. I'm going to call it right at the money. Just as close as you can get. Close you can get. Okay. Remember I told you on a low price stock. Covered call. Not using a lot of buying power. Mm-hmm. What if we sold a call too? So we bought, excuse me, we sold two puts. We have 100 delta's. And we sell a call. Depending on what call we sell. Let's sell the at the money call for a moment. How many delta's would we have now? Uh, 50. Exactly. Because we're losing 50 delta with the call. You're getting short 50 delta with the call. You're getting short 50. Yeah. But you're collecting premium. If we sold the at the money call, the 14 and a half call, or just out of the money, that's the 14 call. I always default to being just out of the money. I never want to sell anything that has any intrinsic value. Even if it's six or eight cents. That's just me. Okay. I always want to sell something that has no value. Why should I sell something that has value? I traded for around $1.91. Selling two puts. Buying one call. Excuse me. Selling one call. Your break evens on this. And we can do it on the curve if you want to. It'll just show it a little bit nicer. Okay. Your break even on this is above, well, it'll say it right there. 1641. And on the downside, you're going to have around 1310 or something like that. 1305. Yep. Okay. What does that risk graph look like to you? That red and green area? Strangle. Strangle. Iron condor. Yeah. It's a neutral strategy. Neutral, but we're taking a bullish. Small bullish. Small bullish stance, unlike a covered call that has no risk to the upside. This has some risk to the upside because options are dynamic. They're going to move, get more delta, lose more delta. But this has a theta decay component to it that's almost three times greater than just a covered call using approximately the same buying power somewhere between $5 and $700 depending on what call you use. You like this? Yeah. Okay. But it's time I can take in premium. I like that. Good. Well, let's go into $1 and see what happens. You're going to confirm and send and send. Let's go over what we talked about today for just a quick second. Really all we discussed here were different forms of synthetic stock. The way to look at the same product, the same trades, the same options, either use more or less buying power to have more or less defined risk, to have more or less theta decay all to your own liking. Does that make sense? And keeping in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Some nice size. And to keep it the same as essentially having those 100 shares of stock. There's a bit of the... You're always going to, if you're going to get more theta decay, you're giving up something else. On a covered call, you have no risk to the upside. On this one, you have risk above $16. Okay? Yeah. All right. Very good, son. Good job, buddy. Do you understand synthetic stock a little bit more or at least the conceptually... Like, you don't have to know the nuances of it. You just have to understand it conceptually. Because then you can look at anything. You'll always be able to have a stock position now, maybe a long stock. And you get to a point where your buying power reduction is too great. How can I get rid of this stock? Use less buying power, but still have the same bang for my buck. You'll know to go to a deep in the money call and you'll know exactly what to pay for that call because you can figure it out. It's really powerful stuff. You're only a couple of weeks into this. Yeah. Now if we can get your account positive, it would be... I know, right. I know, right. I have a good job out of you today. Even the S&P's up 75 cents. Let's hope they fall out of bed. We'll all do a little bit better. Good job, buddy. Who comes next? Tim Knight. What do I say? Okay. I'm also up for it. Good. Thanks, Coolie. In the future. Yeah. It's easy. Is there a high-あの room?
