 Thank you. Thank you. Back. Where do I start? That versus bat. How are you? Good. I'm a little unchanged from yesterday. So that's how you are. Yeah, how you're counting. Yeah. You're counting basically on Jay. My life is either up, down or unchanged now. So it's good. Yeah. It could be a lot worse, you know. It could be a lot worse. All right, so I've got a million things I want to talk about. But you came up to me and I was sitting on my desk earlier today saying, hey, I got a trade. You said it was in Monsanto. We've been in Monsanto before. Let's go to Doe. I want you to go over the trade that you want to do so I can get to what I want to do. By the way, just take a look at your count before you get to that. Is this? This is just your set. This is just your September positions. It's always a good idea to take a look at like, you know, what you have on going coming near expiration September and August. That was first expiration coming up next week. Exciting. It's a big day and making your bones. Yeah. This is the first expiration. Where the, where the, where the action is. We like to be rolling soon. You only have a few positions left in September. I mean, in August, and I'm actually going to talk about one of them. But cool. It's always good to, you can scroll up or down wherever you have them. Just so there you go. So you have all of your August positions are unclicked and your September positions are all clicked. And this is giving you a probably a profit on those September positions that you have on. Why don't you do this? Why don't you unclick them all and then just click September. And I can be done with this part of this little demonstration here. I'm sorry. Click August. I keep saying the wrong things. And all he did was click on the middle of August there. So there's your August position. So basically what's showing you is you're a little bit long a short delta in August. No, short, short delta in August because you're green. You're in the area there, want you to go down, plus you've got those parentheses. And you're a little more neutral to neutral in September. Okay. Make sense? Yeah. Okay, perfect. You had a trade to do that you want to do in Monsanto. Yeah. So I was looking at the 95 110 put string or a put in call for a strangle. So one standard deviation move. Looking at a dollar 14 credit right now uses up about 12 to $1,300 in buying powers. Very similar to the trade we put on that we that I closed about a week ago for 45, 46% profit that time. You know, something to add to the portfolio, I like it. I mean, it gives me a lot of wiggle room there. And then you know, it hits all our benchmarks 74 IVR, one standard deviation move, dollar and credit. Okay. So the most important thing you said there, does set it up to give you the one standard deviation move. So everybody can get that. You like the trade because it has a high implied volatility rank of 74% using $1,300 or everything you said there at one hour percent true. No earnings coming right to the head earnings a couple weeks ago. Yep. Okay. Hit confirm and send and send. It looks like mid price is 115 right now. Let's go into 115 or how about this? It's the end of the day or near the end of the day. Let's go down to 114 where it was just a moment ago. And we'll see if we get filled if we don't move it from there. Awesome. All right, good job. There's no wrong answer. Only time will tell whether the trade was good or not, but the setup fit. Plus you have a lot of money sitting on the sidelines about $24,000 of a $30,000 account sitting on the sidelines you're using about six grand of your buying power. So it's not a it's not a game. Got to get in the game. Okay. So I've got two things. Do you want to look at an existing position that we need to roll or do you want to look at an existing position that we're going to do something really cool with? I guess maybe I'm selling that one. Yeah. Or do you want to look at another opening position in the cues? Let's do some cool. Okay. Let's save it for last because that'll be my it'll be my it'll be my wrap up. Let's go to the cues for a quick second. And I don't have a lot of time to set this up if I have more time later on I will just go to the cues. I look to the cues I WM SPY and the diamonds. Of all of them, the cues have been kind of the strongest. I want to put on some short deltas. We've got a market that's a little bit higher today going into expiration week of next of next week that's that can typically be slightly stronger by our own research. Not quite as strong. Well, it's strong typically. Okay. So so I want to do a slightly short position but a neutral position. Okay. I want to do a wide iron condor. All right. I want to use some buying power not a lot. But let me just show you what I want to do. All right. So if we were to sell just a naked call in here, you can go to nine condor. It's fine. Go to just move the strikes all the way down to one 13 is my short call and one of three is my short put. Very good. And you can leave the you can make the one. Okay. Okay. Okay. And make that one 18. You can step right there. $5.00.00. Go back up to one 18. And make the put also $5.00.00. 98.00. It's trading for around one 14.00. Perfect. Okay. 65% probability of success. If you looked at your September position, if you remember what your probability of success was on your overall position a moment ago. 52.00. Yes. Exactly. So this will enhance your position. And we're a little bullish to in the September too is neutral to bullish. And this is a little more neutral to bearish kind of offsetting a little bit. 114 is the mid price. It only uses around 300. You can click confirm and say, yeah, or the other but uses $386 in buying power. Not a lot of money and buying power relative. It's simulating a short strangle so that if you were to IRA account or something like that, you're giving up about 30 or 40 cents about 30 or 40 cents. By buying those wings, one's about 20 cents. The other one's about a nickel, maybe 30 cents, 35 cents, something like that. But it makes it IRA- I think that cuts your buying power. Cut your buying power down from around 1,300 bucks, which is the same in Monsanto down to about 400 bucks. Why don't we go in at $1.14? It was just there $1.14. Looks like we're rallying a little bit. Like we said, it has a little bit of a short skew to it. Okay. Cool. Good trade, right? Well, I mean, trade trades in and you've got your Monsanto trade in. Good good. About seven minutes left. One more adjustment. Cool. Win. Yep. Go to a chart of it real quick. Win's down to... It's getting close to our short. It's getting close to your short strike, your short put, which is the 90 put, but it hasn't breached it yet. Remember in Apple, we were talking about how if it breaches the short strike, then maybe we'll... We'll adjust down, then that's what we did. We've very, very mechanical with it. I should have added a little bit more to that. If it breaches the strike or you're out of the money option, has little to no extrinsic value, go to his win position for a minute. If it has little to no extrinsic value, you can just click on it if you want to. Those 120 calls, they're trading for around 17 cents. You've put trading for $3.30. It's basically just a short put and win. I know the risk graph can be what it is. It's got a big dollar, it's got a 35 dealt in it. If 35 long dealt in it. If I wanted to be long win selling a naked put, high implied volatility, I leave it. That's basically what you have. Yes, you have a strangle, but it's really just a naked put. I think we have to roll down that call, because that call at 17 cents is giving you no help. Let's roll it down. If we were looking to roll it down, how much delta reduction would be looking to achieve? We're cutting it. It's a percentage. I remember we spoke about this. That's why I'm here. If you don't remember, don't worry. A third to a half. With 30 some days left to go, a third really works. Does that make sense? I don't want to say if that makes sense. I don't want you to go, I don't want you to go as, I want you to still have the directional risk. It hasn't had an uptick since we've put the trade on. Maybe we can buy ourselves an uptick by just rolling down a little bit. I wanted to do that less. You did, and it would have been better. You're right. You're right. It's the second time you said you're right today. Well, second time the market's proved you're right. No, but remember we're emailing about this. I know what you're talking about. If it's not on film, I need to keep record of these. I have emails. If it's not on film, I can't remember. You're short the 120 call. Let's go down to the 110. What does that give you about what is a credit to receive there? 35. So that's not going to be enough. It doesn't make sense. Yeah. I mean, to roll down for 35 cents, it doesn't... The 105 gets me a bar. Ah, the 105 gets you a buck, but you have to buy back your own call that you're short. About 83 cents, I believe. That's where you got to go. So you'd be short to 105, and you'd be short to 90. Still have a little bit of long delta. You're only reducing your delta by about a third. Okay? Okay. All right, let's go in mid price is 83 cents. Let's go in at 83 cents, and we'll see what happens. We can always roll it down. You don't move it down a penny or two. All right. Last one, and the one that I really wanted to talk to you about, let's go into his SPY position if you could. You've got a really unique trade on an SPY. In SPY, we bought a $4 wide put spread by a $2 wide put spread. So we bought a deeper in the money put spread, and sold a $2 wide put spread. That's why you have that risk to the upside. You paid a $1.17. Okay. You're long a $4 wide put spread, short a $2 wide put spread. Your risk is that long put spread. Does that make sense? Yeah. No risk to the downside. You can tell by the graph. If we sell that long put spread, you have on the 7, 9, 13. What synthetic put spread are you long for versus the 7, 9, short put spread? Which way would I need what I want this doc to go at that point? Are you talking about or where would my strikes? Well, the 7 and the 9 is where... You're short the 7, 9 put spread. You're long a $4 wide put spread. The 13, 9. Yeah. So I'm long overall. You're long a put spread, which makes you short. That's why you have no risk to the downside. What long put spread do you have? Where's all your risk? On the 9, 9, 13. Yes? Because I... Oh, which one I'm missing a long one long put on the 13? The 11 put is missing. You've got a... Oh, to make it like an iron condor. To make it into a butterfly. To make it, you have a $4 wide put spread by a $2 wide put spread. A classic butterfly is equal distance on each side. $1 by $1, $2, $2, $4, $4, $10, $10. You have a $4 wide by $2 wide. So you're long an embedded put spread. The embedded synthetic long put spread that you have is the 213 to 11 put spread. If you sold the 213 to 11 put spread for a $1,17, that's what you paid for this spread 25 days ago, whatever. You paid $1,17, right? If you sold just $2 worth of that spread for $1,17, how much risk would you have in this butterfly? Zero, I'd be down to zero. Exactly. And you'd have a $2 wide butterfly with a chance to make how much in a best-case scenario. That'd be $2. $2 on the short. You'd have a free shot. Well, you can sell the 1311 put spread for how much? Let's find out. And we just rallied, so it's going to be a little bit less. So the 1311 put spread. 213 to 11. We'll just move up to six put. The 213 to 11 put spread's trading for a $1,58 mid price. If you sold that for $1,57, go down to $1,57, you'd have an extra $0.40 on top of $1,40. You'd lock in a $0.40 profit. You'd have a free butterfly. You'd be owning that butterfly with a $2 shot with a $0.40 profit. That's a cool trade. Let's go down to $1,57 and sell the spread if we can. The market just rallied, but we'll see what happens. All right, let's take a quick second here just to review what we went through. And I know we went through a lot of trades, but I want to go into that butterfly, because I think it's really, really important. You have an 80 cent profit on that spread right now. You could close that spread and take an 80 cent profit. You still have another 70 cents to reach 50%. You still could make another dollar on top of that. Or you could take off all your risk, sell the and synthetic long put spread for more than you paid for the whole package, have a free butterfly on it. Anytime you can do something for free, plus make that $0.40. I think you got to do it. Cool. All right. Who comes up next? Jim Knight. Peace.
