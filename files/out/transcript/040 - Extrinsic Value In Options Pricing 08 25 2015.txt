 I'm gonna go back to the next episode. I'm gonna go back to the next episode. I'm gonna go back to the next episode. Nicky we're back. Where do I start? Bat vs Bat? How are you today? Good. It's been a much better day than yesterday. Okay. All right. So that's a half-empty scenario. And I love that. Yes. Yes. I mean, I got a good good idea. I don't know if we can talk about it while you're doing it because it's unrealistic expectations. You know, you're you're you're down around $4,000 in your account on the clothes yesterday. You're up about $1,500 in the account that's not typical swings in a market. Especially you trade one contract at a time. With this kind of volatility. It's just not it's just not typical. Well, the other side was not to have three days like this and be positive again. Yeah. Like you can't expect tomorrow to make $1500 even if the market goes your direction and make $1500 the following day and be up $500. You just don't have that kind of you know, delta risk in your account. Now let's look at your delta and it's not weighted. So let's click on weighted and go to beta waiting and we'll set it to spy. So what we're doing is we're looking at everything you don't understand what you're looking at. You're looking at $25.00. But when we click on it and we compare it all to spy you long 128 delta. Now you filled one order already. When we open it up you sold an iwm call spread. You didn't have a position in iwm. We're looking to reduce some delta. You reduced about 20 some delta. Not a ton. 15 20% of the time maybe 10% now with where the market is. Okay. So good day. So it's positive. Harble days in the past. Those were negatives. But we got to move forward a little bit. Okay. So you have a month santo trade that you want to talk about. Open up month santo for a moment. Stocks acting horribly today. Although it was much higher today. I think there are you know. You got up to like 23 24 at one point and then it's kind of been back and forth. It opened to 26 and change. So it was really like right up to where you wanted it to be and stay. 95 call and the excuse me the 95 put in the 99 call. You want the stock to go higher 96. Yes. You know on its way to where you wanted it to be but it's not anymore 91. So what did you want to do here? I was going to roll down the calls to. Give it a trade page please. Bring it all the way down to 95. Okay. Cuts are delta by about 15. Which is 15 of the 20 that you have. Of the 20 that I have. Okay. So the first thing I love to do when I'm looking to reduce delta in my account is go to the positions that I have and reduce delta there. As opposed to adding someplace else like you added an I WM which I'm perfectly happy with. But I also like to reduce to the product of what I have. Okay. So you wanted to roll down this month santo. What's the call that you have? I think it's the. I thought I was higher delta than that. What do you mean higher delta? I'm showing that one at like 50 delta's. And that up that current months. It might have been. Was it beta weighted when I was looking at it? Let's go back to the you're probably correct. Yeah. Because I saw it at like. Yeah, unbated weighted. I'm so sorry. It was beta weighted to SPY. Yeah. I apologize. So you know 50 delta. So I cut it by. Me mean 20 percent. 20 percent. Okay. So maybe we have to go a little bit further. So let's take a look. Great catch. That's great. So you want to do a. There we go. So you short the 99 call. You want to go down to the 95. Yeah, to the 95. And then there'd be a straddle essentially is where I would be at that point. Okay. Let's do it. Sounds good to me. I mean, there's no wrong. There's no wrong answer. Let's see what we can do this for. The only thing that I see bad with this trade is you've got 11 cent wide market on the 96. Excuse me on the 95 call. And let's go up to that out of the money call. It's kind of a little bit better at 17 cents or something like that. All right. So it looks like an 89 cent credit, 91 cent credit now. Let me show you a little bit of a trick. Change that cell to a buy. Okay. So you notice how if I want to buy this spread, it's 92 cents. Go back to the cell. If I want to sell this spread, it's 91 cents. That tells me that each option is not the same width between the bid and the ask. Okay. So you have to be careful. Like when you have a wide market in any of these apps, you have to be careful with your price discovery. Like don't just automatically go in at like 91 cents because it might actually be a 92 bid. And you could have gotten 92 or 93. Okay. So since we just saw that and I don't think you're going to get filled at 91 cents or 92 cents, I think you're actually probably have to go down about 87 cents or 86 cents. But let's take a look. Let's go up to 92 cents and hit confirm and send and send. Let it work and then we'll change it after the show is over. Okay. Okay. So you're going to roll down that. You're going to reduce some delta. So I love that. You had one other that you wanted to talk about. And then on my Twitter trade, I just have a naked put right now. So if I sell a naked call on there, I'm not using any more buying power. Correct. You are 100% correct. And it would cut my delta by about 20, 20, 20, 28. So it was like a third when I was looking at it about 20 minutes ago. So I mean, you cut it in by a third. Right. You have Twitter on its lows for today, which doesn't mean anything. It's just been a big and I own it from significantly higher prices too. So yeah, I look at Twitter as a takeover candidate. But you want to know something. I don't think you can. And I think the mechanical thing to do, like I can't sell calls in there. Because I look at it as a takeover candidate. I've been long it's so long. I just want to be sure puts I want the direction I'll delta in there. But let me take a step back. I also have other positions that are significantly shorter than what you have. Yeah. So everything has to be taken by itself and on its own account. So if you want to sell the 28 call, is that what you wanted to take? Yeah, I mean, that's what I was thinking along the same lines of what I was doing with Mount Santa. Of course, you know extra buying power. You're reducing your delta. I get it. You know. I'll do it. We'll deal with the stock. We'll deal with the stock $5 higher. It'll be a high class problem. Okay. Okay. Okay. Remember what we talked about probability of in the money on that option is 23%. So what's the probability of the stock touching it in the next 24 days? 46. That's correct. It's about double. Okay. Let's go in and sell one of those calls. Let's go in at 75 cents and we can adjust it later on. And if it touches, isn't that like almost best case scenario for me at this point? If it touches in 24 days, it will be the best case scenario. Yeah, that's correct. If it touches tomorrow, it'll be good, not as good. Okay. Okay. If it touches in two weeks, it'll be a good scenario. Yeah. If I go in at 75 cents, it's fine. You're going to change the world's market right now. There you go. It's your offer. It's your one contract is now changing the market disseminated across the world. Pretty exciting. Yeah. I mean, when you think about it, it really is. Okay. Okay. Can I show you one other thing that we could have done in Twitter, but I didn't want to confuse you? Yeah. Okay. So we always talk about how you can roll. Okay. We always talk about how you could roll to the following month and pick up some less delta and some premium. Let me show you how to price that role. So for argument six, let's say you want to reduce your delta, but you didn't want to have any upside risk. Like, I don't want to have any upside risk in Twitter. You don't mind having upside risk and it fits your account. There's no wrong answer. But let me show you something that I might have done in this account. Okay. With this type of trade. All right. Let's look at buying back the September 28 put and selling out, if you just close, you just got filled at 75 cents. And closing out the, so we're closing out the September and sell the October 28 put. How much do you think you're going to be able to do that for? Well, click on it. Just, just click on it. So it says a mid price of around 37 cents. Okay. How do we know that price is accurate? Now it's 40 cents. We really don't. Because the market's wide in there. Look at the call side. Just remember one thing. Everything has its own relationship mirrored by the other side. Calls and puts have the same, remember, remember I told you like, like right now, if you looked at that 28 put in October, how much extrinsic value does it have? Let's say it's at $25 stock. We'll say $3.3 in 10 cents. An extrinsic value. That's intrinsic value. So how much extrinsic value does it have? How much premium does it have? Let me give you a quick little way of looking at it. Just look at the call side. About $1.20. Okay. Put minus call equals parity. Here. Change positions to intrinsic value. So the, the call is worth nothing. It's all premium. The put is worth $3.10, but it's trading at $4.25. Oh, so you're paying $10 or $15? In extrinsic value. Okay. Because it still has... Because anything could happen. Yeah. Nobody's going to sell you something at parity. And let's do it from the last margin. Now right now at expiration, they will. Or a penny or two above. That's extrinsic value contraction over the next 52 days. So if I ask you right now, the 30 puts, take intrinsic value off and just change it to position again. Correct. We're in a time. And just go, go to a lower put, like a 25 put. How much extrinsic value does the 25 put have? Not much. $3.50. Extrinsic value. How much does it have? The difference between the calls and the puts are $5. No. So extrinsic value is premium. Intrinsic value is parity. With the stock at 25, how much is that put worth at expiration? Zero. So how much extrinsic value... That's the whole price of it. To $37. Correct. How much extrinsic value does the 26 put have? $1.93. Right. $1.90, $2.91. Somewhere around $1.90. Okay. Go to another month. Go to November if they have November apps. Go to December. Go... Okay. Stop. Go a little bit further down. Go to the 28 put. How much extrinsic value does the 28 put have? What do we add? $3.50. No. Stop looking at the... No. Stop looking at the stock. Just look at the posing call. The 28 put. How much extrinsic value does it have? Draw an arrow to the 28 call. Right there. It has around $2.35 in extrinsic value. How much extrinsic value does the 30 put have? The 30 put. $3.65. No. Don't get it. Extrinsic value is premium over parity. All you have to do is look at the call. The call tells you what price the extrinsic value is in the put. So $1.75 is that? Exactly. And is that just for... That's for every stock. Especially stocks that don't have a dividend. Stock has a dividend. It could be a little bit different. Okay. Twitter doesn't have a dividend. All right. So we ran out of time here. But I want to do it one more time. So you just stay right where you are. The 27 put in December has how much premium? How much extrinsic value? 264. Perfect. Okay. Go to Netflix. I'm so sorry. I got you. I'll get rid of that. Okay. Go to an in-the-money put. I prefer... I prefer September, October. I mean, but it doesn't matter. Okay. Stay right there. The 122.86 put in December has approximately how much premium extrinsic value? $7.45. Somewhere between $7.45 and $8.30. Let's just say $8.30. $8.30. Okay. Every put up there, you should be able to, from here on out, tell me how much extrinsic value. And it's the same thing with the call. Go up to the call for a moment. I'm sorry. Tim goes along with you like. Stop right there. The 90 call has how much extrinsic value in it? 90 call. It's got none. It's a negative. It's 22 on the call side and... Everything is a mirror image of itself. The 90 call has how much extrinsic value? $7.30. Between $7.30 and $7.70, around $7.50. All right. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. Peace.
