 I'm not very good today, but I'm optimistic and I think that's what you should be and I'm optimistic too. Yeah and you know I've noticed that there isn't you don't always have to like freak out about things there's time and like with the Costco trade I'm not worried I think there are things that we can do and you know I'm not worried about the the the move. Costco trade which? With the Costco trade I mean that trade was going against us the entire time. Oh well and then you waited and we could we waited and we made adjustments and we close it for a profit. So I think of that in the same light here. Okay, all right, so with that in mind, a little bit different than what you said to me on the break. So with that in mind, what direction do you want to take the show today? I wanted to go into rolling in the same duration, kind of similar to what we did with Costco, but these stocks have kind of had dramatic moves in a short period of time since we placed the trade. So I wanted to see like, what's trading talking about? So the two I was looking at were the Apple and the wind strangles that we did? Which one you want to go to first? Let's go to the wind first. Okay, that's going to win. And so we put win on yesterday. Yes, today. And this stock was like 105-ish. We have, or 104-ish, you know, we had $15 on each side was our string. Mm-hmm. And so the strangle for $1.72, pretty much equal distance away? Yes. And so, you know, today the stock's down 488 right now. And, you know, going with what we did with Costco, I'm looking at the call side and thinking to myself, well, I've hit 50% profit over one day. And the calls to buy it back is like, what, 40 cents right now? I sold it for 76. So, you know, just under 40% or 50%. Okay. And, you know, we're still outside of one standard deviation. So I was thinking that we would roll it down in the same month to the 115. Essentially taking that credit, you know, the 50% profit and adding, you know, and selling and taking in more premium kind of gives a little bit more wiggle room to my, you know, put side, my short put, while still staying, you know, outside the standard deviation move to the upside. Okay. So I let you talk because I thought, you know, I'd be able to pick up on some things that you got right and some things that you got, in my opinion, you got wrong. Because there's no real wrong answer in any trade that you make. The only way the answer is going to be validated as right or wrong is what the stock does in the future. Okay. So I'm going to give you some guidelines that we have. You just put this on yesterday. You went to a full standard deviation. 38 days away. This is not a weekly option. It's a monthly option. 38 days away. You now have the stock having a big move of $4, $5, $4.80. I understand the panic in your eyes. And I like that. I don't see it as panic. I see it as an opportunity. Okay. Fantastic. Change that to, to option view, just so we could see the delta on the overall trade. No, I apologize. I know we are looking at win first. Yeah. There you go. And go down to win. Okay. So let's look at the, I love your opinion. I love everything that you said. Let's look at what the numbers say. Your delta is 14 delta. That means you're long 14 shares of stock. You've had positions on that had two, three, four times that amount of delta and you weren't worried about it. It's because it's a big move today. And it is a big move. And then when you put on a strategy like a strangle, you don't want a lot of movement. And when you get a lot of moving quick, it puts you behind the eight ball, so to speak, because you have a small loss in it. You're down 50 bucks on the, on the trade that you put on for a dollar 72, $170. It's a big percentage move. Sometimes with 38 days to go, we just sit and we let the market be cyclical. The rule that we have, not really rule, the thing that we try to follow is when our strike is breached. Or CNX yesterday when we were trading it, your strike had already been breached. Meaning we had gone past there. The biggest mistake, and it's definitely a mistake that you may when you were talking about your overall trade and win is I have a 50% profit on the call. You can't, it's almost like when people say, like, you know, I'll listen to somebody when they're talking and they'll tell me, the market opened up down 50 points. Well, the market can't open up and down 50 points. The market opened down 50 points, then I know you've traded before. Same thing with this. It's an overall position. If you're down 50 dollars on the position, like, I don't care if my left hand makes money or my right hand makes money. As long as together I have a net net profit, you have a net net loss on this trade. You can see on the right hand side around 53 bucks or so. So it doesn't matter that the call lost 50%. We only cover the overall position for a profit when both sides equal at least a 50% profit. That means once I could be zero, the other side could be a full winner, once I could be 25% winner, it's like a 25% winner. We close it all at one time. So if you wanted to move down the win trade, I have no problem with it because there's 38 days to go. I prefer to roll into strength or into weakness. Let me explain. It's down four dollars today. I would want to roll from a place of strength, meaning if the trade was profitable or I wanted a roll, if the stock is low, I wanted a roll that puts closer and collect more premium. I don't want to be chasing it all the time because you seem to chase your tail. Not you. It's just been my experience. Take today away for a moment and let's go to Apple since it was the other one. So let's leave win the way it is for a moment. You got 14 long deltas. Look at all the other deltas you have at any end, you got 64 deltas, Apple you got 26 deltas, CNX you got 41 deltas, you know, three, four times the amount of delta. worry about those because your delta is going to be your risk. Right now it's just volatility expanding and the market moving too fast for you. In Apple you got 26 deltas. That's twice as much as win. So let's take a look at that since you're thinking about rolling. Okay. So the Apple trade you put on I think what do we say on the fourth or so? On the third. On the third. It was about 118, 19 area. The stock was. The stock was about ourselves like $10 on each set of believe it. Okay. And now the stock is 114. Now it's down $5.60 today. Yesterday it was up $4.50. Had we rolled down the calls the day before because the stock had made such a big move while you were on vacation. We never get that move back up. I mean today you're down and this is the biggest one that you're down on. You're down $145, $146 on this trade today. That's a bigger concern to me than the $50 you're down and win. Does it make like I'm trying to. I'm trying to give you good like mechanics on what to look at. Now on the Apple trade you still have high implied volatility. Well it actually went up. When we went in it was about like 41 or 42 in the 40 range. And so this was the one that I would you know was the other one that I was looking at about the rolling idea because the premium is even higher there because we have the higher IVR. Okay. And you know I was looking to take the same concept as the win one and to roll that down to the I think it was $1.15. To the $1.15 stock is $1.14 a change. No I'm sorry the $1.25. Okay. We had $1.35. We went yeah we so we had the $1.30 call and the $1.10 put. Okay. So for the sake of time open up the Apple for a moment. So for the sake of time you would want to roll down the $1.30 call to the $1.25 call and it looks like you can do that spread for around $0.50. Like $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. You could let's think about what it would do to your to your deltas. You'd pick up about six or seven short deltas. You take your delta from around 26 to about 20 for $0.50. It's not it's not bad and you certainly could. I'd rather do it from a place of strength and do it when the stock is rallying. How about we have a little bit of a rule we'll see how it goes or way of looking at it. We won't touch these until the strike is breached. Until then we'll just kind of sit back. Sometimes doing nothing is the heart like like you can only control entry. Remember I told you about like you know the only thing you control is you know your confidence and your entry. You only can control entry. We did this with high implied volatility maybe not the best. Maybe we were struggling to find a trade so we went as far out as possible up until yesterday this trade throughout all of this was a profitable trade. We had a chance to make you know 50 bucks out of a possible 150 bucks. We decided not to take that. Maybe that was our mistake and not looking to do something to enhance or adjust this trade. Now I don't know what's going to happen to Apple tomorrow or the next day or a week from now. I may be rolling down for the 50 cents might have been better. Personally if I was going to roll this down the 50 cents doesn't help me that much. I might think to roll this all the way down to the 120's and do it for like a dollar 70. Then I would basically be neutralizing my deltas by about almost 20. I believe in myself only long about 6 or 8 deltas. You know what I'm saying? Like you got to, I mean if you got to do it, just do it a little bit doesn't help you very much. That makes sense. So for these strangles what we're going to do is we're going to do it for when I've strike is breached. That's what our research shows. I didn't make this up. This is not my 30 years of trading. This is my 30 years of trading and our research. All right? So sit tight. It stinks. But sit tight. All right. So I wanted to talk to you about the oil sector for a moment. And if you go to, well for the sake of time, let's go to the trade page and go to OIH. Now this is something that you brought up to me and I kind of liked the idea and I didn't know that you wanted to talk about rolling the apple and the net and the wind trade that we just did. But you got OIH, high implied volatility is 67%. You want to go to chart of it for a quick second. Maybe you can even use toss if you want. That's great. If you look down at the bottom there, you've got that IV rank. And if you don't have this script, you can get it from our support team. Just email support at tastytrade.com or support Eddo. And they'll show you how to copy and paste this into toss. All this is shown is your IV rank percentile, 67%. Now we could argue that it's been 80 or 90% back in January. But this is the highest it's been in the long time. This is the oil sector. Okay. It's like the producers, it's not actual oil. It's the, what do they call it? Services. There you go. Let's go into forward slash CL just for a quick moment. It's oil itself. And you can see it basically mirrors the same. So it is a play on oil. Oil is at lows. Uh, USO is a real small product going to USO. Also has a decent IV rank, but it's only like a $14 stock. So the option is only about 20, 30 cents, one strike out of the money. Not a lot there to do. Oh, IH. Let's go to a trade page of there in Dove, you'll mind. Let's look at, we've done strangles. Let's look at a straddle. Now straddle is only going to use about $600 in buying power as opposed to the strangle in apple that used, you know, $15 or win that used $17 or $1800. I don't remember the exact number. This only uses 600. So if your buying power reduction is one third of what it is in apple or win, it has to have one third less risk. Does that make sense? Yeah, I mean, like if you're risking last money, you're going to have like a less lower pop and then... You're going to have a higher, well, you're probably, the profit is going to be the same. Your return to the capital is going to be so much greater. It's going to be greater. So, let's look at this. So what our research has shown that it was when the IV rank is high, like at 100, you should look at a straddle. I'm going to make the argument that this is the highest that's been this year. So let's look at a straddle in here. Cool. Okay. So into September, we're selling the 32 straddle that's OIH. Let's just tweak it a little bit. Let's move the put to just out of the money, $31.5, this half dollar wide strikes. And let's move the call... Well, let's leave the call right there at 32 since the stock is almost in the middle at $31.81. I'm sorry. Go to $31.32. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go to $31.32. I'm sorry. They don't have half dollar wide strikes. I apologize. They will in 10 days. Okay. So there's $2.38. On $600 worth of risk, we look to close this at 25% of possible profit. So we wouldn't want to close this at $1.40 profit. We'd want to, excuse me, $1.20 profit. We'd want to close this at around 60... 70... 70......send profit. Makes sense? 70 dollar profit. All right. Let's go into $2.38. See if we get filled. If we don't get filled, you'll move it down by a penny or two. We'll go from there. Now, let's take a quick break on what we discussed today. We actually discussed two things. We discussed our criteria on when we should roll strangles. Talked a little bit about patience. And then we went into the oil sector, OIH, found a high implied volatility, changed our strategy just a little bit from a wide strangle to I would consider this a straddle, although it's not the exact same strikes. Yeah. It's one strike out of the money, but the stock's right in the middle. Makes sense? Yeah. Okay? I'm excited about it. All right, good. Let's make your account a little bit better tomorrow. Okay? Do something about that. Who comes up next? Tim Knight's next. Peace. Just move it down by a penny or two.
