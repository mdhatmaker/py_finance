 You Nicky when I start that versus bat how you son? Not too good today my my Today column is not very very green so speak That's the best answer that you've ever given me to an opening see cuz my day always starts and ends With how the market is doing that's how like I know what's going on It's not if the market's going up or if the market's going down It's whether my account is going up my account is going down So what you're saying is your account is going down today a little bit. Yeah, okay? I feel need a little bit, but it's okay. I click you've been here before to character builder It's it's a marathon not a quick little race. I really haven't been here yet though. I had it's that point. I've had to Small winners I would say I mean that's correct. You've only been doing this a month or less, right? Yeah, okay So it's right but net net your overall and your account your upright. Yes, you're up about a hundred fifty bucks on the high end I think you're up about yeah 80 bucks total now or so and yeah Today, yeah, let's take a look at your account real quick You got the e-mail s and p's down 1550 you got the Dow down almost a hundred and seventy points you can see how your How your risk graph kind of changes real quick with a hundred and seventy point down move or a fifteen point move in the e-mail S&Ps right your overall beta weighted deltas are still relatively nothing right I mean short six deltas is not what I consider You know long or short, but if you look at your risk risk graph you make a little bit more money to the upside now Put the curve put your cursor over the small red area there inside his risk curve. Okay, stop right there So it looks like let's just say the stock goes down a little bit more towards 205 or so and that's the S&P 500 you'd be down around it looks like about another What does that say about a hundred and Hundred bucks, let's say is that what it looks like it's a thousand and then two thousand so I mean just well it should say on the right hand side there I can't select the price two or five and you down 152 you're down about a hundred and fifty two bucks, right? Is that correct? Yeah, you would that yeah, okay, I just want to make sure now. Let's go about the same type area to the to the upside Let's go to Less no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I mean keep going. Yeah, let's just Right go up a little bit more perfect right there and if you're there you're up around 450 bucks If it goes to 210 if it goes to 210 So I mean you've got SPY around in the middle what I'm trying to show you is so okay So you have a portfolio that's basically neutral if we stay right here put your cursor right over the zero Perfect if you stay right here you make back about a hundred and sixty dollars if we go up about two three dollars at Expiration you know you make about four hundred bucks five hundred bucks and change if we go down two three dollars You lose about a hundred and fifty bucks that's trading Like two of the three ways you're gonna make money that's trading Not just like picking something to buy picking something to sell and hoping to be directly right does that kind of makes sense? Yeah, all right cool You've got a vacation coming you're gonna be off for the rest of the week right today's your last day of your week At the end I'll be here holding down the fort make it sure everything gets taken care of you enjoy yourself Being a son have some fun all right So I want to talk about your account going on vacation and what to do so you're actually in my eyes going on vacation The perfect time because there's 45 days left 46 days left till expiration that's our sweet spot So that means today for you it's business as usual and you actually have to get more than one trade on because you're gonna Miss four days worth of trading mm-hmm Does that make sense cool? Like a two trades for you to look at let's do them all right, okay? Let's go to first one. I want to go to is let's go to Apple a P L We can go to a chart of it too if you want to just take a quick look at it I'm gonna kind of go through these as quick as possible Twitter is will be the next one we'll look at Okay It's a year-to-date chart in apples down 10% over the last 10 days alone Um our research has shown that when a stock has a move that's about 10% or more in a short period of time Which we think is around 10 days we could be due for a little bit of a bounce Okay, let's with that in mind Ivy rank is 45 it was just above 50 not too long ago. Yeah, I saw it on the grid page when I was Playing around earlier in the day the stock was down about another dollar from here So it's kind of come back a little bit when it comes back volatility kind of contracts a little bit But if you notice like put a circle on the last time it had earnings not the most recent but the time back in April Okay, so what I'm trying to show you is put a circle that I'm sorry put it you don't You don't do the tools are working. Okay, so If you look at the in the bottom of the page there. I'm look at the ivy rank Last time it had earnings it was around a 50 somewhat percent ivy rank and then it went Quickly down to almost zero. Do you see the green line? Yeah, we're dropped. Okay, so now we go to where we where we just had earnings now So it's around the same area maybe a little bit less about 45 percent quickly jobs drops down to zero and then we're back at like earnings level Ivy rank so I look at this as like an opportunity an opportunity to sell premium in there. Mm-hmm makes sense. Yeah, all right Let's go to Apple a P. I will do it in dope be fine So what's your go what would be your go-to strategy you're going on vacation? Mm-hmm you have plenty of Money in your account to use what would be the strategy that you would use high implied volatility? What do you do? Well, I mean we could I mean we're gonna sell premium so I mean we could sell Strangle on it or okay, so we were selling premium or I mean since the the ivy are is On the lower end of the 50 scale what about if we did like another Like broken wing butterfly to the upside You so broken wing butterfly to the upside Quantified it for me like you know how we had we did that in Netflix where we kind of had zero downside risk What if we did that? Okay, so stop if I have zero downside risk like we did in Netflix Then that's actually the direction. I want the stock to go mm-hmm Does that make sense to you? Yeah, so so if I did a broken wing call butterfly We're at risk to the upside like we did in Netflix that I'd have to be neutral to bearish in Apple Apple's just had a 10% move down. I'm kind of neutral to bullish on it So if I want to do a broken wing butterfly then I would do it to the put side I want to put the risk to the side. I think the stock is not gonna go Yeah, so it makes sense. Yeah, so the puts if we did a pull it would go You know, we would have no risk to the upside if it goes past our that's correct That's correct. I don't hate that But I'd rather just do a strangle for you right now if that's okay. Cool. Is that all right? Yeah, okay? So let's skew it a little bit to the upside since you want since you seems like you want to be a little bit more bullish on it Is that yeah, I'm gonna try to read you we don't talk about this at a time. Yeah, I'm trying to read you Yeah, all right, so let's go to let's go to 45 days. It's fine. Let's go to one standard deviation Which would be my default go to click on go So it looks like with 45 46 days Okay, so do you see some let's see the stock is one let's just call it 119 that's the 105 puts that's 14 Strikes lower mm-hmm follow me so far. Yep, and we got 109 to 135 You're looking at 17 there. What's 16 or 17 strikes higher look at the prices on them You've got the call at 34 cents you got the put at 92 cents Mm-hmm. That's that's Like I'm not gonna sell a call for 34 cents. Does that make sense? There's not you're I mean, you're not getting a whole lot out of that. I don't think I am So let's let's the 105 put for 92 cents. Let's look at the 130 call. Let's go down five All right, so now you're about equal distance away you got about 12 points 11 and a half points to the upside and It looks like you've got about 13 13 and a half points to the downside But the prices are about equal all I'm trying to do is like, you know like how much am I willing to risk for my reward? Okay, so we got a dollar 69 you've got about a 72% probably success. That's perfect for us, right? Okay, you want to skew it a little bit to the upside? Let's see if we move that put from the 105 unfortunately There five yeah, there are five wide so we'd have to go to the 110 we have to go to the 110 or a different month a month with weekly is it I'm gonna prefer and I think you should prefer even in Apple that has liquid weekly markets Meaning they're about six seven cents wide that we stay in the month is it that are basically one penny wide So that okay, yeah, okay, so we're gonna give up some of the strike selection So you got the 110 130 and it's trading for $2.37 Mm-hmm I mean, I think if we're if we're gonna play Tor you know for a bounce to for the stock to increase You know, let's go with the 110 and and you know take the extra premium and you know if we're you know thinking that it's gonna go that direction Let's play that direction. Well, you just took off Costco Strangle that you had on this gonna use about the same amount of buying power that this is gonna use the Costco Strangle was about the same amount of premium That you received in it, but the strikes were a lot tighter. I don't know. I think it's a good use of capital or return Yeah, okay, I agree all right Let's go in a $2.37 and you can change it later if you want to because I'm running out of a little bit of time cool Let's go to Twitter. Let's go to a chart of it Now this is a stock that we've been long for some time the knock-in paid meff again killed in it Yeah, I mean it hasn't it hasn't stopped going down Well, it's got sideways for a while which has been kind of nice, but this moved down now I mean down 20% over the last 10 days trading near all-time Lose for the stock. I don't know bells and whistles go off in my head that you know Maybe we're due for a little bit of a bounce here now you have a Neutral to slightly bullish portfolio. We just put on a neutral trade. I want to put on another little bit of a bullish trade here In Twitter are you okay with that? Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay, so it's a relatively low-price stock So what I'm gonna try to do is I'm gonna try to give you like all the all the Little check marks that I'm looking at and then see if you can come up with like read my mind what what I'm thinking so you've got Decent implied volatility 44% if you look at the last time in add earnings and the time before I had earnings the IV rank went down to around zero Mm-hmm now the IV rank is 44% same thing that we saw in the apple same thing that you saw in apple so we've got a relatively low-price stock you've got a High volatility for the amount of time left You got a stock that hasn't had an uptick Let's go to a trade page of it. What type of strategy would you look for? Selling premium buying premium Selling premium selling premium. So what type of strategy would you look for? Um, well, I mean we just did a Strangle so I mean we could go to like a covered call like we did on our FCX and so we're thinking exactly the same Yeah, I think low-price stock high implied volatility covered call or naked put Same buying power like we just similar buying similar buying power reduction You could make more money with the Covered call you have a higher probability of success with the put Make sense. Yeah, okay You'll decide which one that you're gonna do in Twitter and if you're gonna pick one you're gonna look at September one strike out of the money on the call and one or two strikes out of the money in the put looking to collect around a dollar on the put Okay, make sense. Yeah between you know 90 cents and about 50 something like that. I'll tweet that out after the show good. Okay. Mm-hmm sound good I let's go let's just take a quick recap on what we discussed today So the first thing that we talked about was we just went over your overall account and then we also Looked at your own situation like you're going on a vacation is the rest of my portfolio okay Am I happy with everything I have you also have a nice Netflix trade on that you might think about closing You're up about 60 bucks on it. Yeah again, it's you have to go over your Account that you have and then take into consideration you got 45 days left to expiration That's the sweet spot. You're not gonna touch these trades anyway for a week or two So if you're gonna be on vacation what difference does it make yeah Business is usual business is usual very good son who comes up next tonight. What do I normally say peace?
