Transcript:  I'm gonna be back. Nicky, we're back, first show. Where do I start? Bat versus bat. Big bat, little bat. You want a Maddie? This can be a great thing. It's gonna be fun. So, first show. I thought about it all weekend. I know you talked with me about it. You're a little nervous and apprehensive on what we're gonna talk about on this show. I'm gonna take it really, really slow. Begin a trader. I know that you've been talking to other people out there on the dope platform and different ways of looking at things and what you should be trading. I know you've been doing some paper trading and fake type trading. Which puts you in a good place. Because that's what people who are watching this show today. That's kind of in the same spot that they're in. Meaning that they've gotten some sort of instruction from somewhere they've took it on their own to paper trade. I want to show you what I look at. Now, I've been trading for about 35 years. Been in the business. I remember when I bought my CBOE seat in 1987 and I thought to myself, you know, there's always gonna be a bat on the floor of the CBOE to trade. It's like a dream. I mean, I never thought something like that would come true. And now, with the way things have developed, no more floor trading or anything like that, I thought, you know, having my son in the family business would never come to fruition. But here you are, which makes me extremely, extremely proud and happy to have you on the show with me. So thank you for, thank you for doing so. Are you graduating college? Tell everybody a little bit about yourself. I graduated college on 2012. I studied economics. Went into the finance industry. I worked for a debt buyer. It was an interesting business. I mean, it was my first one right out of college. So I was kind of, you know, thrown into the fire kind of thing. And, you know, after a couple of years, I decided I needed a change. And, you know, why not join my debt trading? And see what's, what his business is about. Fantastic. So, with school and with, you know, your first job out of school, it all comes down to me trading. When I first started trading, like this week, I try to reflect on, you know, my own first trading experiences. When I first started trading, I only traded one or two options of all the options that were there. I only traded one or two options. I tried to learn those one or two options, how they were moving, their normal price range, how they were quoted. Everything about those one or two options. And that's kind of what I want you to, to focus on today. And those one or two options is not just one option in an option series, but calls and puts. Now, a call is usually the first thing that most people will trade when they're looking at options. A call is just the right, but not the obligation to do something. Let's put up the dough platform for a second. And you can see it right across on the screen there. We'll put up the dough platform and we'll just look at calls and puts. It's a very simple stuff. Here's Monsanto, a stock. We can look at an ETF. Let's go into SPY as opposed to an individual stock. Or would you prefer, would you prefer going to something that you might be more familiar with, like Apple or something like that? Yeah, we could go into an Apple. Okay, let's look at an Apple before we get to an ETF. I think Apple's a good stock to use as a, and you can close up the strikes or make them smaller. What's the difference between an ETF and an ETF? What is... Okay, so that's a great question. An ETF is just a basket of stocks. So if somebody was to say something like a, they wanted to buy a mutual fund, they're buying a basket of stocks. If that mutual fund is supposed to mirror the S&P 500, it's supposed to mirror SPY. SPY is an ETF. It's a basket of stocks. It's the S&P 500. It's the 500 most capitalized stocks. So, asking me to name all 500? I can't. But then a movement in one of those underlying doesn't affect, or I mean it affects the overall, but they're altogether. So some go up, some go down, and you know, the overall movement of the ETF is a combination of all of those movements happening. So correct. So I think what you're trying to say is an ETF you would suspect, and probably true in most cases, has diversification. Monsanto is just going to be in its field. Apple is just about Apple stock. Now, if the NASDAQ's going higher, Apple makes a big part of the NASDAQ. If the NASDAQ's going higher, Apple's probably going higher. If Apple's going higher, the NASDAQ's probably going higher. SPY, standing in force 500, we were looking at a moment ago, is a 500 different stock. So yes, some will go up, some will go down. But that's what every fund manager, or almost fund managers, are caged against, meaning if the S&P goes up 5% this year, they're looking how did they do, how did their fund do against the S&P 500? Okay. All right. So we're going to look at Apple, and we're going to stock 125 dollars. Keep it a circle around Apple stock. Thank you. All right. So if I want to buy one share of Apple, I would need $125.54 plus commissions and everything else. So about a, let's just call it $130 to buy one share of Apple. Now, you're 25 years old. $130 might mean one thing to you. Might mean one thing, a different thing to me. And it might mean something else to another 25 year old. But for the way I trade and the way they'd hope that you'll trade, $125.13 is a reasonable amount of money to put into something. Now, if you would have buy one share of Apple, assuming if I bought a share of Apple, I'm assuming the stock is going to go higher. Yeah, you want the stock to go higher. It's a 50-50 shot in our eyes. You can argue that it's a 53-47 that stocks have a natural drift to the upside. Our research shows it's about 3%. So if you were to buy Apple, be a 53% shot your way versus a 47% if you were to sell it. Okay. $125. Apple goes up $10. It goes from $125 to $135. You make $10. Great. Well, great. Yeah, but not a... Let's take a look at... Go to a chart of Apple for a quick second. Apple hasn't had a $10 move in the last... It looks like, well, all of February, March, April, May, and June, it looks like it hasn't had a... It has just about a $10 move if you bought the bottom and sold the top. So kind of like a wasted use of your money in my eyes. I think there's more efficient ways to do it. And that's where options come in. Can you close the chart for me for a moment? All right. I'm not suggesting that you buy options or sell options yet, but let's just talk about what they do when you want to. So for argument 6, if I want to spend the same $100, approximately $125, look in the middle there where it says strike price. Maybe you could put an arrow or something. Perfect. All right. So those are all the strikes that I get to buy Apple at. What strike do you want to pick? There's no wrong answer. Are we going to do a call on it or... Well, a call would be the right to do what? To buy. And if I wanted to do a put, it would be the right to sell. So a call on the dough platform is on the left. You can see where the circle where it says calls. And on the right, it says puts. So we're assuming that we're bullish on Apple. I was just using the example of buying one share of stock for $125. Let's go with that same outlook that we're bullish on Apple. And we want to buy a call. Well, there's a bunch of them up there from the 95 strike all the way up to the 165 strike. Where do you want to buy Apple? Say 130. Why'd you pick 130? Just curious. No wrong answer. Because it's a little over what the price is now. So that figured going higher. Okay. It's fair enough. Now, okay. So now, what if I told you you only had $125 to spend? Now what option you're going to trade? Well, I go for a 120 and save myself five bucks. Well, how would you pay 120? The 120 is trading for what price up there? 755. Right. So that's one option, $750. Now, I didn't tell you this was no way that you could know it. If I was to buy one option there, even though it says $7.50, it's not $7.50. We dropped the two zeros. It's actually $750. So you don't have enough money to do that. What option you're going to buy now? So I'd have to go at the 125 then. At least. Well, okay. So what's the, let's circle to 125? What's the 125 option paying trading for? At 435. So you have $435. You only have $100. Oh, I only have $100. You only have $100. So you buy a 135 or higher? Or higher, exactly. So you'd have to buy the 135 call or higher. Let's just use the 135 call at $100. What you're saying and what you're able to do is remember, an option is a contract. It's the right to do something. If you buy that option at a dollar, you have the right to buy Apple in a designated time, any time from today until 46 days. Can you circle the 46 days? Because we're looking at August options. And you can add more days on to that or... You could trade a different month. Right now we're trading in August. 46 days, you get to own Apple at 135. But you paid a dollar for that. You paid $100. So your break even on that trade is what? It's going to be 136. 136, exactly. So you spent $100. Same $100 if you were to buy Apple one share of stock. You're controlling 100 shares of stock. So instead of buying... I'm trying to show you a leverage here. Instead of buying one share at $125, you can rent out almost like... Have the right to buy 100 shares. But you got to buy those shares $135. And your cost basis is 136. Does that make sense? Yeah. Are you sure? Yes. All right, we'll go over this again. Now, I didn't get to everything I wanted to talk about today. So tomorrow we'll do again. The show is every day from 2 o'clock to 2.15. So let's put an up on our card on some of the things we talked about. And we'll get to the rest of them on Tuesday. Okay. So we looked at buying a call. We really only got to one example today. So buying a call you said to me was a bearishableish... There's a bullish strategy. Bullish strategy. We're buying a call. So if you buy a call, it must be a bullish strategy. If you sell a call... It's a bearish strategy. It's a bearish strategy. It's just the opposite. We haven't talked about puts yet, although I showed you where they were on the screen. So I'm going to save this and we're going to get back to it tomorrow. So all we did was we looked at $100. We have $100 to invest. Showed you what option you could buy. We didn't talk about making money or losing money. But we talked about leverage. One option controls... How many shares a stock? 100 shares. 100 shares a stock. All right. The only thing that's missing throughout everything that we're going to talk about for the coming year or two is confidence. And that's the only thing you need. Like you can learn the strategies. And there really are only a few. Every one of them is just a variation of another form of vertical spread or naked option. After that, it's just fancy names. The only piece that you'll be missing is confidence. Once you have confidence in the strategy, not whether you're going to be right or wrong on direction. But in the strategy, you become a successful trader and so will everybody else out there. Awesome. Good job, son. Tomorrow, thinking cap on, we're going to talk about puts, which is exactly the opposite of calls. Good job, buddy. Thank you.

Transcript:  I'm good. I must have done something right. They let me back for a second episode. So listen, this is going to go on into into fruition. I mean, hopefully this is a couple of year process and you'll you'll grow from the very beginning, which you are right now. With the you know, some information that you've gotten from school, some information that you've probably got from friends, people here at tasty trade in and dough and what you'll learn in in real application. Placing trades. So we're going to start real slow. Yesterday we talked about we did calls. We did calls. And we wanted to get calls and puts a matter of fact, a slide that we showed at the end of the day showed, you know, calls by a call that's bullish. So I want to talk about puts today. And I want to also, you know, reiterate and go back to what we learned yesterday. So I made one more card for you today. Let's take a look at that. Because exactly what we talked about yesterday. It's more of the classic or clinical discussion on what we had buying a call bullish selling a call bearish today. We want to talk about buying a put, which would be bearish and selling a put, which would be bullish. Let's go to the dough platform and take a look at that's the card from yesterday. Very, very simple. We talked a little bit about what a call is. Do you remember what we talked about what a call is? Yeah, it's the right to buy. If you buy a call, it's the right to buy what? 100 shares of the stock. 100 shares of stock. Exactly. Exactly. And it's we're giving somebody else the option to buy those shares of stock from all set of predetermined price. Correct. It's exactly like what's it exactly like? Almost like a contract that you would have with your with your insurance company like for a car or something like that. Touchy subject with you because your car got stolen this weekend, which is a true story, right? You know, it's kind of funny. So you owned your car, right? Yes. But you gave you paid somebody. You paid somebody money to you got a contract back. And with that contract, they said that they would replace your car's value. If something bad were to happen to your car, now something bad did happen to your car. So that would be like buying a call. You have the right, but not the obligation to exercise that contract. Let's go to the dope platform for a second. We'll take a look at what we're talking about. And the last thing we were talking about Apple, this will be the homepage that you'll look at all the time when you see your own will click on the trade page. And we already filled in Apple, but you would have to fill in the Apple stock. You can put anyone you want. We were looking at a call that was trading around $100. And we had so much money we had to spend. We were bullish on the stock was your assumption. You always have to have an assumption calls are on the left. We were buying a hundred shares of we were buying a contract. You really weren't buying any stock. And our 135 strike price actually went up. So I wouldn't even be able to afford it today. Today you would not be able to afford it. Or if you bought it yesterday, you'd be making $5. Yeah. But that contract is the right to buy the stock at what price at the the strike that I'm buying it at at the 135 135. But your cost basis would be the today would be the 104 is what I'm paying today. So it would be $104 to buy that. Correct. But if you bought that option for $100 yesterday, let's just say for argument six, you bought it a dollar. Your break even price, your cost basis for Apple would be it would be the price of the strike price plus whatever I paid for it. So the if it was yesterday, it'd be $136 today. You know, 136 and 4 cents with the stock trading at 125. Yeah. But it only cost you $100 to control that contract control 100 shares of stock. One contract, one option contract. Controls 100 shares of stock. We discussed yesterday if you had a hundred or 125 dollars, you could buy one share of Apple. That's leverage. So you got calls on the left. Buy a call. I want the stock to go higher. You kind of jumped the gun a little bit. If I sell a call, you could argue that you want the stock to go lower and you would be correct. You also would argue that you have stayed the same. Well, you're selling premium just like your let's go back to your car example for a moment. You've been driving your 25 years old. So you've been driving for seven years. Let's just say for seven years you've been buying your own insurance. So for seven years, you've been buying that contract from the insurance company that you never exercised. So all those years of premiums that you paid, you never got to collect on. Now one bad thing happens and you get to collect on it. That's very similar to how options work, especially when you're buying an option that's out of the money stocks at 125. You're buying an option that doesn't make any money at expiration until the stock gets to over 136. That's a big move. Yeah. That being said, let's just talk about puts for a moment puts the mirror image the opposite of calls. So if I buy a call, that's bullish. If I buy a put, is that going to be bullish or bearish? That's going to be bearish. Exactly. Because you're ensuring yourself in case this, this stock goes up. In case it goes down, if I buy a put, let's just talk about buying for a moment, because I think when you're a new trader, it's it's easier to grasp the buy side. If I buy a call, I want the stock to go up. If I buy a put, I want the stock to go down. Now, a lot of individuals, millennials and my mom, who's in our 80s, doesn't understand that you could buy something and still benefit by going lower. That's why everybody who invests in the market or your own daughter, my own daughter, your sister, who first got a first 401k was like, okay, so what do I invest in that's going to go up? Market has two sides. You can even argue it has three sides. It can go up, down, or stay sideways. There's ways to benefit in all market conditions. That's what we're going to try to learn over the next year or two that it takes us. But let's talk about puts for a second. So if we're going to buy a put and we had that same $100 on the dough platform, the puts are on the right hand side. What put would you be able to buy or closest to buy? The 110 would be the closest to the neck. The 110 looks like it's trading for around was at 54. The next one's at 111 so that'd be too expensive. The 115 is at 111. The 115 is at 111. We'll take the liberty of being able to round that you have 110 dollars or 112 dollars to buy that. So you'd be able to buy the right to benefit if the stock goes below what price at expiration? Well, if I'm paying the 111 for it, so if it goes below the 114 or 113.89, then I would be covered. Exactly. You're covered down to and then have no risk below 113.89. Let's just say you paid a dollar for it. 114.10 and below, you would have no risk. Now, at first thought, the stocks 125, if I wanted to benefit from a down move in the stock, I can invest as a little as $100 and benefit from the stock going lower. So the call we benefited from the stock going higher, the put we benefited from the stock going lower. Buy a call I want the stock to go. So think about it. Like with your own type of contract, you could buy both those contracts spend $200 and if the stock goes a lot higher, you benefit. How do you lose? It stays where it is stays exactly where it's because there's time premium. How much time premium are you buying? What's the expiration to August? How many days? To August. It looks like it's 21 of 45 days to August. So when you buy that option, you're buying that option that contract for 45 days. All right. So let's wrap it up for a quick moment here. What did we learn from yesterday? When you're buying a call, you're buying a call options, the contract that gives you the right, but not the obligation to buy a stock at a specific price within a specific time frame. That time frame that we discussed today was 45 days, the price that we talked about on the call was 135. The put is the mirror opposite. The put allows you to benefit when the stock goes lower, meaning you get to benefit as the stock goes lower, you can benefit from a market on both sides higher or lower. So tomorrow we'll talk about how much it would cost you to sell those options. All right. Sounds good. What do we normally say after this? We always say who's coming up next? Tim Knight is coming up next. Peace. Peace.

Transcript:  I'm good. I must have done something right. They let me back for a second episode. So listen, this is going to go on into into fruition. I mean, hopefully this is a couple of year process and you'll you'll grow from the very beginning, which you are right now. With the you know, some information that you've gotten from school, some information that you've probably got from friends, people here at tasty trade in and dough and what you'll learn in in real application. Placing trades. So we're going to start real slow. Yesterday we talked about we did calls. We did calls. And we wanted to get calls and puts a matter of fact, a slide that we showed at the end of the day showed, you know, calls by a call that's bullish. So I want to talk about puts today. And I want to also, you know, reiterate and go back to what we learned yesterday. So I made one more card for you today. Let's take a look at that. Because exactly what we talked about yesterday. It's more of the classic or clinical discussion on what we had buying a call bullish selling a call bearish today. We want to talk about buying a put, which would be bearish and selling a put, which would be bullish. Let's go to the dough platform and take a look at that's the card from yesterday. Very, very simple. We talked a little bit about what a call is. Do you remember what we talked about what a call is? Yeah, it's the right to buy. If you buy a call, it's the right to buy what? 100 shares of the stock. 100 shares of stock. Exactly. Exactly. And it's we're giving somebody else the option to buy those shares of stock from all set of predetermined price. Correct. It's exactly like what's it exactly like? Almost like a contract that you would have with your with your insurance company like for a car or something like that. Touchy subject with you because your car got stolen this weekend, which is a true story, right? You know, it's kind of funny. So you owned your car, right? Yes. But you gave you paid somebody. You paid somebody money to you got a contract back. And with that contract, they said that they would replace your car's value. If something bad were to happen to your car, now something bad did happen to your car. So that would be like buying a call. You have the right, but not the obligation to exercise that contract. Let's go to the dope platform for a second. We'll take a look at what we're talking about. And the last thing we were talking about Apple, this will be the homepage that you'll look at all the time when you see your own will click on the trade page. And we already filled in Apple, but you would have to fill in the Apple stock. You can put anyone you want. We were looking at a call that was trading around $100. And we had so much money we had to spend. We were bullish on the stock was your assumption. You always have to have an assumption calls are on the left. We were buying a hundred shares of we were buying a contract. You really weren't buying any stock. And our 135 strike price actually went up. So I wouldn't even be able to afford it today. Today you would not be able to afford it. Or if you bought it yesterday, you'd be making $5. Yeah. But that contract is the right to buy the stock at what price at the the strike that I'm buying it at at the 135 135. But your cost basis would be the today would be the 104 is what I'm paying today. So it would be $104 to buy that. Correct. But if you bought that option for $100 yesterday, let's just say for argument six, you bought it a dollar. Your break even price, your cost basis for Apple would be it would be the price of the strike price plus whatever I paid for it. So the if it was yesterday, it'd be $136 today. You know, 136 and 4 cents with the stock trading at 125. Yeah. But it only cost you $100 to control that contract control 100 shares of stock. One contract, one option contract. Controls 100 shares of stock. We discussed yesterday if you had a hundred or 125 dollars, you could buy one share of Apple. That's leverage. So you got calls on the left. Buy a call. I want the stock to go higher. You kind of jumped the gun a little bit. If I sell a call, you could argue that you want the stock to go lower and you would be correct. You also would argue that you have stayed the same. Well, you're selling premium just like your let's go back to your car example for a moment. You've been driving your 25 years old. So you've been driving for seven years. Let's just say for seven years you've been buying your own insurance. So for seven years, you've been buying that contract from the insurance company that you never exercised. So all those years of premiums that you paid, you never got to collect on. Now one bad thing happens and you get to collect on it. That's very similar to how options work, especially when you're buying an option that's out of the money stocks at 125. You're buying an option that doesn't make any money at expiration until the stock gets to over 136. That's a big move. Yeah. That being said, let's just talk about puts for a moment puts the mirror image the opposite of calls. So if I buy a call, that's bullish. If I buy a put, is that going to be bullish or bearish? That's going to be bearish. Exactly. Because you're ensuring yourself in case this, this stock goes up. In case it goes down, if I buy a put, let's just talk about buying for a moment, because I think when you're a new trader, it's it's easier to grasp the buy side. If I buy a call, I want the stock to go up. If I buy a put, I want the stock to go down. Now, a lot of individuals, millennials and my mom, who's in our 80s, doesn't understand that you could buy something and still benefit by going lower. That's why everybody who invests in the market or your own daughter, my own daughter, your sister, who first got a first 401k was like, okay, so what do I invest in that's going to go up? Market has two sides. You can even argue it has three sides. It can go up, down, or stay sideways. There's ways to benefit in all market conditions. That's what we're going to try to learn over the next year or two that it takes us. But let's talk about puts for a second. So if we're going to buy a put and we had that same $100 on the dough platform, the puts are on the right hand side. What put would you be able to buy or closest to buy? The 110 would be the closest to the neck. The 110 looks like it's trading for around was at 54. The next one's at 111 so that'd be too expensive. The 115 is at 111. The 115 is at 111. We'll take the liberty of being able to round that you have 110 dollars or 112 dollars to buy that. So you'd be able to buy the right to benefit if the stock goes below what price at expiration? Well, if I'm paying the 111 for it, so if it goes below the 114 or 113.89, then I would be covered. Exactly. You're covered down to and then have no risk below 113.89. Let's just say you paid a dollar for it. 114.10 and below, you would have no risk. Now, at first thought, the stocks 125, if I wanted to benefit from a down move in the stock, I can invest as a little as $100 and benefit from the stock going lower. So the call we benefited from the stock going higher, the put we benefited from the stock going lower. Buy a call I want the stock to go. So think about it. Like with your own type of contract, you could buy both those contracts spend $200 and if the stock goes a lot higher, you benefit. How do you lose? It stays where it is stays exactly where it's because there's time premium. How much time premium are you buying? What's the expiration to August? How many days? To August. It looks like it's 21 of 45 days to August. So when you buy that option, you're buying that option that contract for 45 days. All right. So let's wrap it up for a quick moment here. What did we learn from yesterday? When you're buying a call, you're buying a call options, the contract that gives you the right, but not the obligation to buy a stock at a specific price within a specific time frame. That time frame that we discussed today was 45 days, the price that we talked about on the call was 135. The put is the mirror opposite. The put allows you to benefit when the stock goes lower, meaning you get to benefit as the stock goes lower, you can benefit from a market on both sides higher or lower. So tomorrow we'll talk about how much it would cost you to sell those options. All right. Sounds good. What do we normally say after this? We always say who's coming up next? Tim Knight is coming up next. Peace. Peace.

Transcript:  Can we Nikki we're back where do I start? back to back how are you good I was your night last night um it was good. It was tough I had I had some tough homework and I Couldn't figure out where was your homework? My homework was to get a a stock that I was bullish on and a stock that I was bearish on. 15,000 stocks to choose from. We have software that basically does most of the work for you. I gave you the criteria and set up and you had a hard time finding a couple of stocks. It was. It was. I mean, their earnings time is coming up. So it was really hard for me to find one that didn't have earnings within the next 45 days. That was really the hardest thing to find. The IVR stocks. I mean, I was able to find those, but something that didn't have any. Hi, IVR. High implied volatility rank that we always look for. Yeah. Good. So, especially one that I was had bullish or bearish idea on. I found one for bullish. So you're a permable. I'm a permable. Really? Okay. Well, maybe we didn't know it. Maybe we didn't know it, but we call this bad versus bad for other reasons, but maybe it's because I'm typically a permabar or at least when markets are at all time highs, which they are now. I'm typically a lot more bearish than when markets are at lows or have made a big move down. Then I kind of get bullish. I kind of go both ways, but I'm really a permabar more than anything else. I love to sell. If I've got my palms out and I'm selling is what I'm most comfortable. But you're thinking that you're a permable. How many trades have you made in your entire life? Zero. How do you know what you are? I haven't picked a side yet. No, no, no, it's good. I don't want you to pick a side. I mean, truth be told, again, on the show that we do all day for almost five hours a day, markets have been going up for the most part. So I'm a contrarian. I like to sell when everybody wants to buy. I like to buy when everybody else likes to sell. So what I want to do here and throughout the show is I want to stay as neutral as possible and make you grow to your own comfort just so that everybody out there can grow to their own comfort. But you also have to have some sort of market assumptions. So to say that you're a bullish trader, quote unquote, bulls trader, or even a bearish trader is way too early when you haven't made a trade. So you have no idea what you are or what you're going to become or how you're going to like to trade. You know, everybody develops a different style. Tom Saasnoff and myself have worked together for almost 30 years doing the same type of business, same type of trades. We're typically on the same sides of the market. But I might do a different strategy than he does. I don't want to risk as much capital as he does. I want to risk more capital as he does. I'd rather have a higher probability of success trade than a 50-50 shot trade that he might put on. So that's what happens in a civil partnership. Watch our show. It's not so civil sometimes. But yes, okay. So you had a homework assignment. I digress. You had a homework assignment. We were looking for a bullish stock and a bearish stock. What did you come up with? And how did you come up with the process? So the stock that I chose to be bullish on was Baba. Okay. And the reason I picked that was that, I mean, it's relatively... Could have shot up a Baba if you don't mind. You don't have to. Nick, let's have the team do it for a moment. Good. It's at a relative low point. I think it was about $4 or $5 above its lowest point that it's been at. And you know, it obviously was one of those stocks that opened and was kind of on fire when it came out. And so... This is a 52 week chart above. And again, it's just for demonstration purposes. I don't look any technicals or if there's more green or more red or anything else like that. I just look at it for price. So I'm going to look at it like a new trader like you. So you said it's relatively at a low price. What time frame did you look at? Well, the 52 weeks. I mean, since... Well, that's 52 weeks. But how do you judge something as high low? So here's what I'm saying. Baba's not the greatest example. But if you were to tell me, you should say that Baba's at an all-time low. Because for 52 weeks, it really hasn't been any lower. Yeah, it's a lot of... So it's not relatively low. It's at an all-time low. But it only has four months worth of data. If we were looking at another stock like Apple or something like that, put a Apple for a moment. And again, I just like to go to Apple because it's widely held and people understand what the stock is. So here in Apple, if I were to show you a 52 week graph of Apple, you would say, high end low end, which end? High end. High end. Now let's change that graph to a 30-day graph. Okay, now is it at the high end or a low end? Low end. Okay, so how can a stock be at the high end or the low end? My point that I'm making here, just bear with me for a moment. Because we're trying to learn. We love the pushback. I think the audience wants you to push back. And I want you to push back. Because this is the only way that you're going to be able to learn or at least not even learn. That's a bad term. It's the only way that you're going to get to formulate your own opinion is if you have something else to look at, besides your own opinion. Because your own opinion is very public and new. You've never made your first trade. So give me a benefit of the doubt for a moment. And let's look here. So let's talk about the stock at the high end of its range and the low end of its range at the same time. This is why I hate to look at charts for anything other than price. And price for where something's been. Now for me, when I'm- And price change, yeah, like day to day, you brought a Baba. I don't trade Baba a lot, but it's been in the news, so I kind of know where it's been and where it's going. That other stock that you mentioned yesterday, PRAA. PRAA. If I didn't see a chart of PRAA, I would have no idea where it's been or where it's going. That doesn't where it's been and where it is. That has no bearing on where it's going to go. The only thing I can judge it by, where the things that I gave you yesterday, and we'll recap them in a minute. Okay, so we just prove that looking, you know, depends on what time frame you look at. It gives you what your opinion is on high end to low end. So I got to throw that out. Like I can't use that. Now we're going to live in a 40- Well, what, well, you tell me. I told you when we were going to open a trade, what was the optimal time? Like how much time till expiration do we typically look at? Do you remember? Yeah, it was 40 to 45 days. Around 45 days. Okay, so to give myself a little bit of room, three to six months, that's about as much time as I'm going to look at it as stock. Does that make sense? If you're going to look at a graph. If I'm going to look at a graph just to get a view. So let's just keep the 52 week the way we have it. But really, I'm only going to look at the last six months or so. And you've got, was it, have it July, August September? That has a full year, right? Is that a full year? Yeah, 52 weeks. Okay, so I'm only going to look at like the last half of the graph. Does that make sense? So if I was looking at Apple, I would say to myself, you know what, Apple's what? In the last six months, the red box. I mean, in the middle. Yeah, it's mid range. Okay, so then I'd have to look at the applied volatility. The applied volatility is IV rank. 51. Yeah, 51 up on top there. You could put a circle around the feet if you don't mind. Or it arrows perfect. All right, 51%. But we know that Apple has earnings coming. So Apple gets thrown out. And we can't make the tread. We can even pull up the six month IVR that Doe uses as well. You could. On there. I mean, if it sure is there a correlation there? I mean, if you're looking at six months worth of stock movement, is a six month IVR, something that you would. It is. And I have no problem using it as long as you do it all the time. Okay. Okay, so like, like I have no problem with you looking at a one month. I have a one month IVR. I don't think it's enough time. But as long as you use it all the time, stay consistent. Then I'm okay with it. I like 52 weeks. Some people argue that that six months is better. It's all your personal preference. Makes sense? Yeah. Okay, short a period of time gives you a little bit less of a, gives you more of a, like we just looked at the stock a moment ago. From one year, gave you a lot of data points on the chart. Six months gave you a little bit less. One, one week, a one month is going to give you a lot less. And I think six months is kind of like a happy medium. So if you were doing like a longer term trade, if you put on a trade that's, let's say, has 120 days or 110 days, would you use? Stop. What's your optimal time to put on a trade? 40 to 45 days. So why are we going to talk about something we're never going to do? It's true. Makes sense? Mm-hmm. Okay, so give me one of the stocks that you said you couldn't find. I couldn't find. I couldn't find. So I'm a little bit upset. So I'd have to, like, remember, yes that we talked about sitting you out of a football game. Yeah. How many games a year? Well, I was never good at football. Hold on a sec. I never did that. Well, you graduated in four years. So you must have done something well in college. Yeah. So we only played around 10 football games a year, eight to 10 football games. Something like that. And you had to sit out one because you didn't do one of your homework assignments or get something done right. So the first day, you didn't do your homework. 15,000 stocks. I showed you exactly what, okay. I couldn't find a stock stock. I had an ETF that I... Okay. We'll live with that. It's like doing your homework but not really. Yeah, like halfway. Like halfway. So what were you bullish on? So I was bullish on IWM. IWM, you were bullish. Can I ask why? It doesn't matter because there's no reason. Same thing with taking a look at the chart and just deciding that, you know, it was in the last year, it's at a high point. And... So you think it's gonna go higher? No, to go bearish is go down. Oh, bearish. Oh, it was your bearish play. I thought you said bullish. Oh, I apologize. I mean, bullish was, was, was Boba. Oh, your bullish was Boba and your bearish was IWM. Yeah. You know what? I don't mind it so much as, you see, I'm, I'm a contrarian, right? So you got Boba on the low end. You've got IWM on the high end. For me, that fits. Now, that's not the reason why I would want you to make the trade or not. But it fits my logic. Like, to me, I'm selling something that's high. I'm not selling the low. And I'm buying something that's low. I'm not buying the high. Yeah. Most public does it exactly the opposite, the same way that you walked into this room. The insurance idea was that it's, you know, if you have a stock at $100, you, you know, you want to buy that insurance so that if it goes down, you hedge that loss. 100%. Yeah. So my goal on the show was, when we did, when we did back to cool with Katie, last person I did the show with, we had somebody else doing most of the trades for us, meaning they would run that we call the driver and make the trades. My goal with you is I want to watch you as a, as a new trader stumble along on the platform, make the mistakes so that you can learn how to use the platform really, really well. So you said, and we're running out of time, you said that you were long, want to be long on Bob and short on IWM. Okay. So tomorrow, first thing, as soon as we get in here, that's the trades that you're going to make. And I'll show you how you're going to make them. Let's try to, let's try to wrap up everything that we, that we just learned here or we have learned over the last couple of days. And I've got another homework assignment for you. All right, so the first thing that we were looking at, we really didn't get to it with selling premium. I want you to sell premium. And if you're bullish on Bob, I want you to sell a put. And if you're bearish on IWM, I want you to sell a call. The things that we look at are liquidity. You certainly can go back to best practices and that's your homework from 217.15 and everybody out there can do it. And just watch that 15-minute segment on liquidity. There are others and there might even be others that are better than that. But at least you can find one you can understand a little bit more about liquidity and how you can find stocks instead of stumbling on them. No earnings was something that we looked at. Did you look at when Bob had earnings? I didn't, I mean, I didn't see that it was, I don't think it's within 40 days. Okay, we don't, we don't think. We know. So you have to check if Bob has earnings. Does IWM have earnings? ETFs don't, ETFs, I don't want to, I'm not here to trick you. ETFs don't have earnings. So IWM, SPY, any ETF doesn't have earnings. So you don't have to worry about that. So when earnings season's coming along, you might want to lean towards and look for trades in an ETF. High IV rank, does Bob have a high IV rank? Yeah. Okay, so you're good there. But you got to check for earnings because I think earnings are coming up. 45 days to open is a market measure from 117.14 and there are others that you can look at for our criteria on opening trades. All right. Tomorrow's Friday, let's get a trade done. You're going to make your first trade tomorrow for sure in those two stocks. You're going to be selling IWM, you're going to be buying Boba. Who comes up next? Tim Knight? What do we say? Peace.engois horizon of policy exchanges.

Transcript:  I'm gonna go back to the next episode. I'm gonna go back to the next episode. I'm gonna go back to the next episode. Nicky we're back. Where do I start? Back to back. Back to back. How are you? Good. How was your night last night? Um, it was good. It was tough. I was bullish on and a stock that I was bearish on. Um, 15,000 stocks to choose from. We have software that uh, uh, basically does most of the work for you. I gave you the criteria and set up and you had a hard time finding a couple of stocks. I, it was. It was. I mean, their earnings time is coming up. So it was really hard for me to find one that didn't have earnings within the next 45 days. That was really the, the hardest thing to find. I, I mean, I was able to, to find those but something that didn't have any. Hi, I have high implied volatility rank that we always look for. Yeah. Good. So, um, especially one that I was. Had a bullish. Or a bearish idea on. I found one for uh, bullish. But, so you're a permable. I'm a permable. We're ass. Maybe we didn't know it, but we call this bad versus bad for other reasons, but maybe it's because I'm typically a perma bear Or at least when markets are at all time highs, which they are now I'm typically a lot more bearish than when markets are at Lows or have made a big move down than I kind of get bullish I kind of go both ways, but I'm really a perma bear more than anything else I love to sell if I've got my palms out and I'm selling is what I'm most comfortable, but you're thinking That you're a perma bull. How many trades have you made in your entire life? 0 This is how do you know what you are? I haven't picked a side yet. No, no, no, no, it's good. I don't want you to pick a side pick a side I mean truth be told Again on the show that we that we do all day for almost five hours a day Markets have been going up for the most part. So I'm a contrarian I like to sell when everybody wants to buy I like to buy when everybody else likes to sell So what I want to do here and throughout the show is I want to stay as Neutral as possible and make you grow to your own comfort just so that everybody out there can grow to their own comfort But you also have to have some sort of market assumptions. So to say that you're a bullish trader quote-unquote bulls trader or even a bearish trader is way too early when you haven't made a trade So you have no idea you have no idea what you are or what you're going to become or how you're going to like the trade You know everybody develops a different style Tom Saasoff and myself have worked together for you know almost 30 years doing the same type of business same type of trades We're typically on the same sides of the market But I might do a different strategy than he does I don't want to risk as much capital as he does I want to risk more capital he does I'd rather have a higher probability of success trade Then a 50 50 shot trade that he might put on so that's what happens in a civil partnership This is a lot of time. Yeah, if you watch our show it's not so it's not so civil sometimes But but yes, okay, so you had a homework assignment. I digress let you had a homework assignment We were looking for a bullish stock and a bearish stock What did you come up with and how did you come up with the process? So the stock that I chose to be bullish on was Boba okay, why and The reason I picked that was that I mean it's relatively short up of Boba if you don't mind that you don't have to it Nick let's have let's have the team do it for more good It's at a relative low point. I think it was about four or five dollars Above its lowest point that it was it's been at and You know, obviously it was one of those stocks that opened and and was kind of on fire when it when it came out and so This is a fifty this is a fifty two week chart above and again It's just for demonstration purposes. I don't look any technicals or if there's more green or more red or anything else like that I just look at it for price So I'm gonna look at it like a new trader like you so you said it's relatively at a low price what time frame did you look at? Well the 52 weeks. I mean, well, that's 52 weeks, but but how do you judge something as high low? So here's I'm saying Bob is not the greatest example But if you were to tell me you should say that Bob is at an all-time low Because for 52 weeks it really hasn't been any lower Yeah, so so it's not relatively low. It's at an all-time low But it only has four months worth of data if we were looking at another stock like Apple or something like that Put a baffle for a moment and again I just like to go to Apple because it's widely held and and and people Understand what the stock is either so here in Apple if I was to show you a 52 week graph of Apple you would say High-end low-end what which end high end okay now let's change that graph to a 30-day graph Okay, now is it at the high end or a low end? Low end okay, so how can a stock be at the high end of the low end my point that I'm making here just bear with me for a moment Because we're trying to learn and I love the pushback like I I think the audience wants you to push back And I want you to push back because this is the only way that you're going to be able to learn or at least not even learn That's a bad term. It's the only way that you're going to get to Formula your own opinion is if you have Something else to look at besides your own opinion because your own opinion is very Public and new you've never made your first trade so give me a benefit of the doubt for a moment and let's look here How can a stock be at the high end of its range and the low end of its range at the same time? This is why It's a question. This is why I hate to look at charts for anything other than Price and price for where something's been now for me Price change yeah like day today like you brought a Baba. I don't trade Baba a lot But it's been in the news so I kind of know where it's been and and where it's going that other stock that you mentioned yesterday P R a a if I didn't see a chart of PR a a I would have no idea where it's been or where it's going That doesn't where it's been and where it is that has that has no bearing on where it's going to go The only thing I can judge it by were the things that I gave you yesterday and we'll we'll recap them in a minute. Okay, so We just prove that that looking you know depends on what time frame you look at That gives you what what your opinion is on high end to low end so I got to throw that out like I can't use that Now we're gonna live in a 40 well what well you tell me I told you when we were gonna open a trade What was the what was the optimal time? Like how much time till expiration do we typically look at do you remember? Yeah, it was 40 to 45 days around 45 days Okay, so to give myself a little bit of room Three to six months. That's about as much time as I'm gonna look at it a stock. Does that does that make sense? If you're gonna look at a graph if I'm gonna look at a graph just to get a just to get a view So let's just let's just keep the 52 week the way we have it But really I'm only gonna look at the last six months or so and you've got Was it have it July August September that has that has all has a film that has a full year right? Is it a full year yeah 52 weeks okay, so I'm only gonna look at like the last half of the graph Does that make sense? So if I was looking if I was looking at Apple I would say to myself, you know what apples what in the last Six months the red box. I mean in the middle yeah, it's mid range. Yeah, okay So then I have to look at the applied volatility applied volatility is IV rank 51 yeah 51 up on top there you could put a circle around the few if you don't mind or arrows perfect All right 51% but we know that apple has earnings coming so apple gets thrown out can't make the trade We can even pull up the six month IVR that Doe uses as well you could on there I mean if sure is there a correlation there I mean if you're looking at six months worth of stock movement is a six month IVR something that you would It is and I have no problem using it as long as you do it all the time Okay, okay, so like like I have no problem with you looking at a one month IVR I don't think it's enough time, but as long as you use it all the time stay consistent then I'm okay with it I like 52 weeks some people argue that that six months is better It's all your personal preference make sense yeah, okay short a period of time gives you a little bit less of a it gives you more of a Like we just looked at a stock a moment ago from one year gave you a lot of data points on the chart Six months gave you a little bit less one one week a one month is gonna give you a lot less And I think six months is kind of like a happy medium So if you were doing like a longer term trade if you if you put on a trade that's let's say has 120 days or 110 days which you use stop What's your optimal time to put on a trade 40 to 45 days? Why are we gonna talk about something we're never gonna do? Make sense, mm-hmm, okay, so give me one of the stocks that you you said you couldn't find So I'm a little bit upset so I'd have to like remember yes that we talked about sitting you out of a football game How many games a year? Hold on, I said you know I did that well you graduated in four years So you must have done something well in college. Yeah, so We only played around ten football games a year eight to ten football games Something like that and you had to sit out one because you didn't do one of your homework assignments or get something done Right so the first day and you didn't do your homework 15,000 stocks I showed you exactly what okay? I couldn't find a stock stock I had an ETF that I that I okay, okay, well we'll live with that it's It's like doing your homework, but not really like halfway Like halfway you just like all right, so what so what were you bullish on? So I was bullish on I WM I WM you a bullish can I ask why it doesn't matter because there's no reason Same thing with taking a look at the chart and just deciding that you know It was that in the last year. It's at a high point and So you think it's gonna go higher? No to go bearish is go down. That was a bearish. Oh, it was your bearish play. I thought you said yeah He said bullish. I apologize. I mean was was Boba or your bullish was Boba and your bearish was I WM Yeah, you know what I don't mind it so much as because see I'm I'm a contrarian right so you got Boba on the low end You've got I WM on the high end for me that fits now that's not the reason why I would want you to make the trade or not But it fits my logic like to me. I'm selling something that's high I'm not selling the low and I'm buying something That's low and not buying the high. Yeah, most public does it exactly the opposite the same way that you walked into this room The insurance idea was that it's you know if you have a stock at a $100 you you know you want to buy that insurance so that if it goes down you hedge that loss 100% So my goal on the show was When we did when we did back to cool with Katie last person I did the show with we had somebody else doing most of the trades for us Meaning they would run that we call the driver make the trades my goal with you is I want to watch you as a as a new Trader stumble along on the platform make the mistakes so that you can learn how to use the platform really really well So you said and we're running out of time you said that you were long want to be long on Boba and short on I WM Okay, so tomorrow first thing soon as we get in here That's the trades that you're going to make and I'll show you how you're going to make them Let's let's try to let's try to wrap up everything that we that we just learned here or we have learned over the last couple of days And I've got another homework assignment for you All right, so the first thing that we were looking at we really didn't get to it was selling premium I want you to sell premium and if you're Bullish on Boba I want you to sell a put And if you're bearish on I WM I want you to sell a call the things that we look at are liquidity You certainly can go best back to best practices and that's your homework from 217 15 and everybody out there can do it and just watch that 15-minute segment on liquidity There are others and there might even be others that are better than that But at least you can find one you can understand a little bit more about liquidity and how you can find stocks instead of Stumbling on them no earnings was something that we looked at Did you look at when Boba had earnings? I didn't I mean I didn't see that it was I don't think it's within Fourteen days. We don't we don't think we know So you have to check if Boba has earnings does I WM have earnings? ETFs don't ETFs. I don't want to I'm not here. I'm not here to trick you ETFs don't have earnings So I WM SPY any ETF doesn't have earnings So you don't have to worry about that. So when earnings seasons coming along You might want to lean towards and look for trades in an ETF high IV rank Does Boba have a high IV rank? Yeah, okay, so you're good there But you got to check for earnings because I think earnings are coming up 45 days to open is a market measure from 117 14 and there are others that you can look at for our criteria and opening trades All right, tomorrow's Friday Let's get a trade done you're gonna make your first trade tomorrow for sure in those two stocks You're gonna be selling IWM you're gonna be buying Boba who comes up next Tim Knight What are we saying peace good job Nicky?

Transcript:  I'm doing well. Happy birthday. I mean, it's not enough that we spend 15 minutes together every day. I have to have a shirt with your face on. Is it too much to spend 15 minutes with your phone? No, no, that's great. That's the best part. For those who don't know, this is my son, Nikki, a new trader, really never traded before, correct? Yeah, we're going to do the first one today. Okay. All right. So you told me, what did you tell me on the break when you sat in here? Well, yesterday I came in a little over Zalus. I didn't really know what I was doing and today you do. Oh, yeah, today I've changed completely. I'm a new man today. But today I wanted to at least make it easier on myself and kind of use some of the programs that we have at our fingertips. Okay, good. So what do you have planned? So what do you what is it until so that entails two stocks that don't have earnings? Okay, so I have always had a thing where and Tom do it, Tom and I do it on the show also we don't talk about anything in advanced in advance of the show because we want it to be spontaneous, just want it to be fresh, want to be new and I want you, you're in a tough situation because I want you to make, I mean, I don't want you to make mistakes, but I want you to make the mistakes that a new trader is going to make so that everybody at home who has never seen the dough platform before or used it and quite frankly, I don't use it enough. I want them to see the mistakes that you make you doing it and finding a stock so that we can so that they can learn from the process too. So okay, so what do you have planned? So what I want to do is I want to go into dough, use the grid and you know filter by a stock by our criteria and like I told you on the second show, on the second show, you did do it on the third or the fourth show. Yes, yes, but today, so you're following, so you're going to follow, here's a difference, here's a difference, is that today I'm controlling. Okay, so let's put your computer up there and okay, so that's you, right? You're moving your mouse. That's your account. Yeah, it has about $30,000 in it. That's what we always start with or that's what we start with past shows that we do. So you got about $30,000 in it to margin account that allows you to do basically anything that you want to do as long as you have the buying power reduction to make the trade. I mean, as long as you have enough money in the account that the broker firm holds and leverage, you can make any trade on the Sun. That's futures options, stock, whatever you want. Naked, not naked, any strategy that you want. You welcome. Thank you, thank you. So we're going to go to the grid page on the left hand side. Okay. And from here, we'll filter by a high options volume. So that's one of our criteria that we're going to start with. Okay, so stop right there. And truth be told, when we started the show in the break there, you told me what you were going to go to. So I'm going to go to this high option volume. What did I tell you to go to? I said, you'd be high option. Naked, this is why you had to sit out that one football game, you know, you listen, but you just miss it. Notable stocks, notable stocks, not high option volume. But let's go to high option volume because that's what we're looking for. We got to find something that has perfect. Let's go to high option volume stocks. Okay. Good. And then we're going to do the filters, the ones with the blue circle, the ones that don't look like a target sign, those are the ones that are selected. So we want to exclude earnings within a certain range. And we're going to put that to 45. That's fine. And now 45 days is our is our wheelhouse. I usually, and 45 days is perfect to have that. So you're excluding all earnings inside zero to 45 days. Yeah. Because one of the things that we looked at, one of the things we talked about was we wanted no earnings. That's perfect. So good. The next criteria, we're going above 50, I, I, VR on this, right? I, VR is IV rank. It's really just an average. It's 49, 51, 45. It doesn't really matter. Okay. So the next thing, and I didn't show it to you, click on the implied valve rank right there. Okay. So that'll sort all of the tiles high to low or low to high. So in yours, if you click it one more time, it'll make it 50 to 100. You'll notice that FIT has 51. Click it again. And now on the left hand side, there you have Asher with 100 and will bring it down to 50. When we're selling premium, we prefer the higher implied volatility. Okay. So I wanted to go into Costco because Costco. Okay. So stop. First trade, we want high implied volatility. We love volatility between 50 and 100. 100 being better than 50. Costco has an IV rank of 54. Yes, it meets the criteria. If it was my 30th trade in my month of trading, I'd say sure. Go to Costco. If it was my first trade, I personally wouldn't go there. I'd try to stick to the one. Stay where you are. I would personally want to be in the 100. But let's go to Costco. It works. Go ahead. So I'm going to click on the trade button and it'll pull up my Costco. Okay. I usually like to work on the curve to start with just because I'm a visual learner. So I like to see it. Okay. You know, before we go with it. Yeah. And listen, I'm just going to give you my two cents along with you. When Doe first came out, we only had the curve view. We didn't have a table view. We only had a curve view. And then Tom and myself and a bunch of other people all talked about, said, let's put a table view in there too, which is more in the style of toss, think or swim the way it looks. But I like to curve as a visualization too. And I think as a new trader, the curve view with that win and loss and green and red is a good indication, a good way of visualizing something. I grew with 100%. Okay. So what are we looking at? So although we're not at the highest end of IVR that we can be, I figure that Costco it's been up and the whole openheimer fund says that this is, you know, buy this by that. So I figure we play that and we do a call to the downside. Heimer, last Heimer, Heimer, Heimer, buy this by that. Okay. So whoever this person is knows more about, well, I'm saying maybe somebody's listening to him or, you know, so because it's up $3.50 because you think it was this news, this is why it stocks up. So you're going to fade that move. Yeah. Some of fade that I'm going to go against the view. Okay. And you said this stock's been up or higher or something like that, right? Today. Today. Today. It's been up to bucks today. Let's bend some up over the last couple days. What does it say it's up? Today, $351.00. Right. So it's not up $2.00. It's up $3.50. That's actually a pretty big move, right? Yeah. Okay. So all right. Okay. All right. I like what you're saying. I like what you're saying. We'll go over tomorrow. The different things. Okay. So what do you go ahead? All right. So we're going to sell a call on this. So you want to sell a naked call. Do you know how much? Do you know how much? Sorry. So go ahead. Which call are you going to sell? First of all, you're going to be in what month? I'm going to be in August at 42 days out. Okay. So you are in August 42 days out. And the strikes that we have on there are $5 wide, right? There's the one. Are you in August with? Yeah. I'm in. Okay. Perfect. 42 days out. So you can see the in the middle of here is how many days out that very good. It's a joke you just made. I like that. No. You listen, you know the dough platform a lot better than I do. So you should point out these things. This is going to be awesome. All right. So you're selling that call at it looks like a mid price of around $2.17. Say $2.15. Okay. Well, the natural is 2.15. Go ahead. That was kind of my question was like if you know the difference between a 145 strike and a 150 strike. You know, 150 strike. Mm-hmm. It went from 170 from Sorat like, you know, 50 cents, let's say. What are the 40 46? 46 and that's enough. 30. Are you talking about the change in the? One option is $2.15. You can see it on the left hand side. Yeah. Right on the bottom. Right. Okay. Stay right there. And that option 70 cents. So you sell one option, the 145 option. Stay right where you are. You can sell the 150 call. You have an 80% probability of success. It's high. It's great. We like to have a wheelhouse. Remember, you can only control entry. Risk and everything is controlled on entry period. You can't control something after the fact. What's that? That's okay. All right. So 70 70 cents. Let's just round 70 cents. Do you know how much buying power reduction you're using for this trade? Probably a lot. Right. Unfortunately, in Doe, we're subject to only the information that we get from the website, TD Ameritrade's website that we feed off of. And it shows max loss of unlimited. It doesn't give you a buying power reduction. It's about 20% of the stock. It's about $2,600 to sell one call to make 70 bucks. We would want to manage that trade at a 50% profit, which would be $35. So stop. Now worth the time. For that reason, there's probably no, it's worth the time. That strike's probably not worth the time. So let's go back to the 145. There are only $5 wide strikes. Okay. Now the stocks 143. You're selling a 145 call. You went from a 80% probability of success to about a 69% probability of success. Let's just round it and say 70. 80% to make 70 cents, 70% to make $2.8. For me, $2.8, at least I'm using $2,600 to possibly make $208, which we would look to manage at somewhere around $100. Now all of a sudden, you're becoming a little bit more, to me, a little bit more in my wheelhouse. For us on entry, we like to sell something for at least a dollar. So if I'm going to sell a naked call or a naked put, or I'm going to sell a naked call and a naked put combined, I want to collect at least a dollar. That's my criteria. So you want to sell this call with 42 days to go to expiration for $2.8. Your break even on it, click it one time, is going to be the credit received plus the strike price. 145 plus 208 is 147.08 and you can see that right where it says max profit, winds up being less than or equal to $147.9. It must have taken the penny. Your maximum possible profit is 209. Do you know what that chart is on the right hand side? That chart on the right hand side tells you the amount of days it takes to possibly make 50% on the trade. All right, so let's unclick that for a second. Get out of it. Okay, this is your trade. If this is the trade you want to make, I'm going to let you make it. Because you have to make these mistakes yourself, and then tomorrow I'll show you what I think you should do, like on Monday. All right, so let's go with that. Okay, perfect. So let's put it in. What's the, go ahead. You've got to click it. So hold on a second. Hold on before you click it, go back for a minute. Up or right, just click on the X. It's okay. Stop clicking around. You like your like your money. You're like your all over the place. Relax. Actually, I think you've been here once or twice. Even though it's your only first time. This is the first one. So the market is 209, 221. Mid price is 215. So let's change your price down at the bottom left. To 215. Up to get it. Okay, now you can hit confirm and send, or review and send. And now you can click send on the right hand side. Good. Okay, you're filled. You sold your first option. You sold your first call. Bullish a bear strategy. Bearish strategy. You want the stock to go lower? We'll stay the same. We'll stay the same. Take take Nicky off his computer for a minute and let's look at a chart of Costco and I know we have a minute or two left or less. Because I just want, I just want to go back to the statement where you said here's a chart of Costco. You said it's been going higher. It has been going higher over the last four four days or so. I have no problem making this trade because you did everything you were supposed to do. You looked for high implied volatility, a little bit of a contrarian role, high probability trade. Now it's up to the option gods. All right, let's think about what let's let's review what we learned here for a moment. So the only thing the only thing that we can control is entry. And that's what you were doing today when you sold one contract thought about how much premium you were using $2600 and how much money you were going to receive and your probability success. The only thing I think that you should have done different in my eyes was look for an ETF because the markets would just would be a little bit tighter. But I love what you did here. You did perfect. You did everything I asked you. What do you think you're probably successes on this trade? I'm just 68 percent. That's what it was at the beginning. Have a great weekend. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. Tim Knight, a rerun of Tim Knight. What do we say? Peace.

So what do you go ahead? All right. So we're going to sell a call on this. So you want to sell a naked call. Do you know how much? Do you know how much? Sorry. So go ahead. Which call are you going to sell? First of all, you're going to be in what month? I'm going to be in August at 42 days out. Okay. So you are in August 42 days out. And the strikes that we have on there are $5 wide, right? There's the one. Are you in August with? Yeah. I'm in. Okay. Perfect. 42 days out. So you can see the in the middle of here is how many days out that very good. It's a joke you just made. I like that. No. You listen, you know the dough platform a lot better than I do. So you should point out these things. This is going to be awesome. All right. So you're selling that call at it looks like a mid price of around $2.17. Say $2.15. Okay. Well, the natural is 2.15. Go ahead. That was kind of my question was like if you know the difference between a 145 strike and a 150 strike. You know, 150 strike. Mm-hmm. It went from 170 from Sorat like, you know, 50 cents, let's say. What are the 40 46? 46 and that's enough. 30. Are you talking about the change in the? One option is $2.15. You can see it on the left hand side. Yeah. Right on the bottom. Right. Okay. Stay right there. And that option 70 cents. So you sell one option, the 145 option. Stay right where you are. You can sell the 150 call. You have an 80% probability of success. It's high. It's great. We like to have a wheelhouse. Remember, you can only control entry. Risk and everything is controlled on entry period. You can't control something after the fact. What's that? That's okay. All right. So 70 70 cents. Let's just round 70 cents. Do you know how much buying power reduction you're using for this trade? Probably a lot. Right. Unfortunately, in Doe, we're subject to only the information that we get from the website, TD Ameritrade's website that we feed off of. And it shows max loss of unlimited. It doesn't give you a buying power reduction. It's about 20% of the stock. It's about $2,600 to sell one call to make 70 bucks. We would want to manage that trade at a 50% profit, which would be $35. So stop. Now worth the time. For that reason, there's probably no, it's worth the time. That strike's probably not worth the time. So let's go back to the 145. There are only $5 wide strikes. Okay. Now the stocks 143. You're selling a 145 call. You went from a 80% probability of success to about a 69% probability of success. Let's just round it and say 70. 80% to make 70 cents, 70% to make $2.8. For me, $2.8, at least I'm using $2,600 to possibly make $208, which we would look to manage at somewhere around $100. Now all of a sudden, you're becoming a little bit more, to me, a little bit more in my wheelhouse. For us on entry, we like to sell something for at least a dollar. So if I'm going to sell a naked call or a naked put, or I'm going to sell a naked call and a naked put combined, I want to collect at least a dollar. That's my criteria. So you want to sell this call with 42 days to go to expiration for $2.8. Your break even on it, click it one time, is going to be the credit received plus the strike price. 145 plus 208 is 147.08 and you can see that right where it says max profit, winds up being less than or equal to $147.9. It must have taken the penny. Your maximum possible profit is 209. Do you know what that chart is on the right hand side? That chart on the right hand side tells you the amount of days it takes to possibly make 50% on the trade. All right, so let's unclick that for a second. Get out of it. Okay, this is your trade. If this is the trade you want to make, I'm going to let you make it. Because you have to make these mistakes yourself, and then tomorrow I'll show you what I think you should do, like on Monday. All right, so let's go with that. Okay, perfect. So let's put it in. What's the, go ahead. You've got to click it. So hold on a second. Hold on before you click it, go back for a minute. Up or right, just click on the X. It's okay. Stop clicking around. You like your like your money. You're like your all over the place. Relax. Actually, I think you've been here once or twice. Even though it's your only first time. This is the first one. So the market is 209, 221. Mid price is 215. So let's change your price down at the bottom left. To 215. Up to get it. Okay, now you can hit confirm and send, or review and send. And now you can click send on the right hand side. Good. Okay, you're filled. You sold your first option. You sold your first call. Bullish a bear strategy. Bearish strategy. You want the stock to go lower? We'll stay the same. We'll stay the same. Take take Nicky off his computer for a minute and let's look at a chart of Costco and I know we have a minute or two left or less. Because I just want, I just want to go back to the statement where you said here's a chart of Costco. You said it's been going higher. It has been going higher over the last four four days or so. I have no problem making this trade because you did everything you were supposed to do. You looked for high implied volatility, a little bit of a contrarian role, high probability trade. Now it's up to the option gods. All right, let's think about what let's let's review what we learned here for a moment. So the only thing the only thing that we can control is entry. And that's what you were doing today when you sold one contract thought about how much premium you were using $2600 and how much money you were going to receive and your probability success. The only thing I think that you should have done different in my eyes was look for an ETF because the markets would just would be a little bit tighter. But I love what you did here. You did perfect. You did everything I asked you. What do you think you're probably successes on this trade? I'm just 68 percent. That's what it was at the beginning. Have a great weekend. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. Tim Knight, a rerun of Tim Knight. What do we say? Peace.

Transcript:  I Nikki when I start that versus that me and you you and me how's it going good good hectic day out there Right it has been hectic though Netflix split has been all there's been a lot of support questions coming in for that So we've been busy with that, but yeah, it has been a hectic day here So those who don't know you also do support when you're not this 15 minutes of fame that you have doing live Internet TV Pretty cool. Yeah, yeah, I'm on the chats the live chats through Tasty Trade though Also doing emails to the small the support desk and call-ins a little bit of everything so beautiful It's what startup does everybody does a little bit of everything. Yeah, do you ever see me empty out the dishwasher? No definitely not yet. I haven't done it a long time I'm just kidding Used to do it all the time. We first started Okay, so how are bonds doing today? Up a what a buck 30 right now buck 40 up like that point and 11 One 11 tips however you want to phrase it you could say you were right Nick You take me to tweet this morning. I was that Was like oh yeah, I was down about a half a point this morning, which is a large move a point and a half the other direction Is a even larger move, but yes this morning the bonds were down Half a half a point and they tweeted out that you had your mother's market awareness, which was much Well, no, but they were up Then and now we could put up if you want to if you want to put up a chart of I don't put up a chart of TLT since we're not gonna be trading Futures in your account for quite some time. Let's just take a look at a chart of TLT So you can't get any tighter than that right? Yeah, that's just one day So that is one day. Yeah, it's one day. Oh good. I didn't see the left side So that one little that one little tiny red spot at the beginning is the one you were talking about Yeah, the people who help us didn't put the box there in a timely fashion otherwise it would have gotten that right Yeah, so that's the one day chart. So yeah, so they were lower they've rallied and Did you sell a vertical spread? I did not were you gonna sell a vertical call or put spread put spread Push for because you were bullish on the product. All right cool. So yesterday Didn't allow you to sell a call spread or get or put spread or or get to because we hadn't discussed what it is So I like to discuss what a vertical spread is and then we'll find something to do Let's just take a quick little recap on what your position is right now Why don't we since we have that screen up there? We can go to your screen later on Nick when we go to make a trade But let's just go to your portfolio That is your full portfolio. You're short a Costco 145 call and you're short a Costco 135 put and it looks like you're up about Today you're up about $14 and change on the overall trade I think you're up around 20 some of ours is hard for me to see on the on the overall trade. Okay Let's see. Where's the call trading at what price? Isn't the whole thing the extrinsic extrinsic value to get it close up that yeah close up. No, no you can There we go You know go to the upper right there and make it Yes, thanks click on it. All right. So you got $265 in extrinsic value you sold the call at 217 I think you sold to put it 70 cents 60 69 69 cents you got two eight six and it's trading for $265 So you've got yourself 21 bucks in profit not bad with the stock not going in the direction you want yet Still have a high probability of trade anything over 50 50 we consider high probability trade You're probably a profit on this overall trade is 62 bucks. What has helped you on on this overall trade Let's go to let's just go to the trade page and click on Costco Do you remember what the ivy rank was in Costco when you put on your first trade ever? It's like 52 or 53 somewhere around 100% correct and right now it looks like that's 43 So volatility is contracted by 10% and the stock still hasn't gone your way when you sold that call Just to show you what a decaying assets like Give it to the arrow for a minute go to the table for for a second and let's take a look at what that Trade kit out of July and go down to August Okay, so the call that you sold was the 145 call if you can draw an arrow to it It's 197 208 right now you sold that call at a mid price of two dollars and 17 cents with the stock about a dollar lower It was about a week ago Monday. I believe it was a trade to make sure I'm Monday Friday Friday blessed So we made the trade on Monday was the put that was money was put there we so the put we sold with the stock higher than where it is Now so stocks gone lower the puts lost money But the stocks gone higher the calls lost money. That's a perfect storm for us Now we want the stocks just to kind of sit here Contract a little bit and we set a reasonable expectation of about a dollar a little bit over a dollar over a dollar our original credit Received 50% of our original credit received 217 around a dollar dollar five dollar eight dollar ten anywhere in there 95 cents anywhere in there is it would be an acceptable Place to close it. Let me give you one more little secret or a little bit of trade hack or something like that That should typically happen on average in about 20 days after you put on the trade if you're placing these trades around 45 days to expiration that's just the way the numbers work out if it works out it's about 20 days from now Is that just a general ruler is that based on? It's not a guy it's it's based it's based on on research that we've done here a tasty trade and there's a bunch of market measures on it You certainly could send an email to Research at tasty trade.com and they'll give you a you know a couple of segments for you to check out and you should do that yourself too So at least you have the numbers behind it. I mean, I know you're gonna take my word for it because I'm your father But you know somebody else out there might not you know believes I say the truth all the time all right so Emanuele S&P is done four dollars and 50 cents this becomes a part of market awareness Do you know what the Emanuele S&P's? That's the S&P 500. That's what would all fun managers or like like like like When I was a kid people would say what's the Dow doing? No way would said like what are what's the S&P 500 doing? As the market matured everything became you know, what's the market doing? They still quote the Dow they still talk about the Dow But anybody in the business or in the know who or anybody who does their own investing They always want to know what the S&P 500 is doing because 500 stocks 500 most capitalized stocks is a better indication of what the overall market is doing than a select 30 And then having the or the the big wide range of of everything Now, you know that that would skew it more than than the 500 top 100% it's you know so funny because Everything we talk about is how We need number of occurrences S&P 500 versus the Dow 30 so you want when you're trading you want a number of occurrences You want to put on as many trades you can to have a flatter skew meaning You know one goes higher one goes a little bit lower and everything kind of you hope everything kind of works out for itself All right, so you've got one trade on so that's like Micro managing a position meaning you know, I'm gonna put on one thing I'm gonna find the best trade and I'm a sit and watch or they like you could drive yourself nuts because you were doing that right I got the itch right now I'm like oh gotta put on a couple more. This is that's exactly what you said to me Yesterday when we're on the show you were talking about like let's do a vertical spread what haven't even told you what a vertical spread is or at least I know you're working here at tasty trade And I know everybody out there who's watching this has watched other segments So they know what a vertical spread is but it's always good to go back to the basics And let me give you the setup for what we want for a vertical spread so let's go Let's go into do we use we use a screen that we have up there and then we'll get to your Screen for you to place the trade Let's just go into the just because they can draw the arrows on here. It's a little bit easier for me. Yeah, let's get out of this and go to The the tiles on the left hand side called the grid And this is what I do every day. I'm looking for a trade. I'm looking to sell sell the first thing I want to do is sell Valtili so I'm looking for high implied volatility so click on the funnel Get rid of all the excluding earnings Let's go to 37 days to expiration You can do zero to you can do 50 to 100 first if you want to it doesn't matter me So we're looking for an IV rank around 50 to 100 and then change that from zero to 120 down to 37 now you have it right already Otherwise zero to 37 for the earnings because we want to take those out of our range because we don't we don't want the earnings to occur Before that expiration or right on the expiration could have said better myself and then click off of that and We don't have a big and if you remember on Friday we had about Three or four rows of stocks to pick from today. We only have five. So what does that tell you volatility is doing? It's probably going lower. I mean, there's not a lot of stocks that have high volatility Perfect it's contracting. I just want to make sure that you get it. I'm messing the same question That's what make sure that you're getting it. I see the same question in a different way Okay, so of all the stocks up there for reasons that we'll go into it another day Greek the first one FXC and Asher. I'm gonna throw them out Greek is a is a ten-dollar stock markets are a little bit wide in there. I don't have a problem with you Trading that stock, but I'm a little bit of a of a bull on a dip Meaning that I want to buy that stock As the stock is going lower, we call that buying into weakness. I like to buy something when it's going a little bit lower I like to sell something when it's going a little bit lower previously I like to sell something when it's had a more momentum move or going a little bit higher I like to sell into strength, so I like to sell something when it's going a little But higher I like to buy into weakness I like to buy something when it's going a little bit lower Why I think I'm getting it in a discount, and I think I'm selling it to the premium I don't know if it's going to go higher or lower, but that's just my thinking. Always in a contrarian role. And I hope that you developed that same type of style. Okay. Next thing that we have up there is TLT. Now TLT are bonds that's what you want to trade yesterday. If we're looking for high implied volatility, everything being relative, that's the highest most, highest implied volatility, most liquid product that we have on the board. So we should have a position in there. Now, let's hold on a minute. If you look at the tile, it says it's up $1.36. It's a big movement today. Big movement up. So I must owe you some money because you want to sell a put spread in there. So you did good. Okay. So now what are we going to do? Since we've had a big move up of around 1%, a little over 1% on the stock, let's look at selling a put spread like you wanted to, which is a bullish strategy. And since the stock's ran up already, let's sell a call spread too. Also, together, it's called an iron condor. It's two vertical spreads of vertical spread and a credit spread are exactly the same thing. It's like saying six of one, half dozen of another. Vertical spread, credit spread, same exact thing. Makes sense? Makes sense. Debate spread is buying the spread. Credit spread is selling the spread. We're going to sell two vertical credit spreads. We're going to sell a call spread and we're going to sell a put spread. We're going to make the same type of risk graph that you have in Costco. We're going to do it all with one click and we're going to use a lot less buying power. Okay. Let's get off of this screen for a moment and let's get to your own screen and put in TLT for me. So we forget about Costco for now. We leave that on. We already know how we're going to get out of the trade. You can certainly go there and do you have something in there, right? What is that? Hold on. What do you got? That was just so clear it on the right hand side dish. Should everybody do that? Okay. Beautiful. So Do does a great job of setting us up at a one standard deviation. Let me let me let's show you what Do does and then let's see how we can modify it to fit our own entry criteria. Remember the only thing that we can control is entry. So that's number of contracts and what strategy we pick. We're picking a high implied volatility stock, high IV rank. So that means we're selling premium. Let's go and click on strategy for me. And then we're going to go down to iron condor. Now, before you click on anything else, look at what the box does right in there. It shows you a risk graph of the strategy that you're going to do. Like if you didn't have somebody talking to you and telling you what an iron condor is, if you looked at that risk graph, you're selling a call selling a put that's closer at the money and you're buying a call and buying a put that's further out of the money to define your risk. Okay. So we want to do a normal iron condor. That's the top one. Go to your advanced settings for a moment. Okay. So expiration 15 days. Let's hour optimal time to get into a trade. 45. So let's put 45 in there and see what happens. Do we like to trade weekly options or monthly options? Monthly is what we prefer. So get rid of the weeklies. You don't have to have that on there now. If you want to do a weekly trade someday, we'll look at it. Click on one standard deviation. Okay. Well, with the strikes. Now here, this is an interesting thing about an iron condor as opposed to a vertical spread. And I would have loved to have done a vertical spread today, but markets just don't permit us to do that. Meaning you were bullish on the spread the time you were bullish on the stock. The time to do it was yesterday when you wanted to. That doesn't make sense to do that. Same. Well, I don't know if it's going to go higher, but it just had a 1% move. It's not the type of product that has that large of a move typically. Although it's been very volatile lately. So maybe we'll just play the movement back and forth. Okay. Total widths. So if I'm risking, if I define your maximum risk, because you see how it says it on the right hand side. So if I went $1 wide, I have $100 worth of risk. If I did a $2 wide, I have $2 worth of risk. $5 wide, I did a $5 worth of risk. How wide do you want to go? I mean, it depends on what kind of credit I'm getting is how I would. Okay. So as a new trader, that's a pretty good answer. And it's a fair answer, and it's not a wrong answer. I'll give you what we've, I've given you what we found so that you have good rules or at least good guidelines, $3. $3 wide iron condors with around 45 days to go to expiration seems to be the best risk reward from our research. So let's start with $3. All right. $3. And click go. Okay. So brought you to August with 37 days, which is perfect. It's got you see those two white lines there right about where your two short strikes are. That's a one standard deviation move. 85% of the time, the stock stays inside that one standard, excuse me, around 75% of the time, the stock stays inside. That's really 68%. 68% of the time, the stock stays inside that one standard deviation range. What's your credit received? 56 cents. 56 dollars. Okay. So we have a little bit of a rule here. We like to collect around one third of the width of the strikes. Okay. So one third of the width of a $3 wide strike would be around $1. So let's tighten up our widths. Okay. Now stop for a moment. You've got about $1. About one third of the width of the strikes. Look at the prices on the call that you're selling. 66 cents. And look at the price of the put that you're selling. A dollar two. Do you see that? Yeah. Now they're both about, well let's see, 17 and a half to 22. You're about five down. You're a little bit closer on the put side, correct? Make sense? Let's just take that put side down a little bit and then move the call side down a little bit. So just stay right there. The strikes, all the widths to the left. Well, that way. Thanks. Okay, perfect. So now we went from a one standard deviation range. Now we moved it into kind of almost equal. Does it make sense? You're trading for around the same price that you call is trading for. It's still $3 wide. You're getting around that $0.90. Let's route this one time at $0.89. You're probably going to have to move it by a penny or two to get filled. But we'll leave it right now the way it is. Okay. Let's try to review a little bit about what we talked about today. And tomorrow I'll go over more of what an iron condor is and all of the benefits of why you should do a condor possibly over the directional. The directional aspect of a vertical spread. I'd say the trade that you put on had a had a 58% probability of success. We can say that a high probability trade because it's anything over 50%. A vertical spread is a simultaneous purchase and sale of two options. Same type, same expiration dates, but different strike prices. Same type meaning both calls or both puts. In your case, you did two vertical spreads. You did two vertical credit spreads at the same time to make an iron condor. You okay? You're fine with it? Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. Who comes up next? Tonight. A rerun of 10, right? We're on for the seven times. We're going live? Oh, last call. Oh, yeah. Never mind. Last call. I'm still on duty. Too nice back tomorrow. Peace. Yeah.

We first started Okay, so how are bonds doing today? Up a what a buck 30 right now buck 40 up like that point and 11 One 11 tips however you want to phrase it you could say you were right Nick You take me to tweet this morning. I was that Was like oh yeah, I was down about a half a point this morning, which is a large move a point and a half the other direction Is a even larger move, but yes this morning the bonds were down Half a half a point and they tweeted out that you had your mother's market awareness, which was much Well, no, but they were up Then and now we could put up if you want to if you want to put up a chart of I don't put up a chart of TLT since we're not gonna be trading Futures in your account for quite some time. Let's just take a look at a chart of TLT So you can't get any tighter than that right? Yeah, that's just one day So that is one day. Yeah, it's one day. Oh good. I didn't see the left side So that one little that one little tiny red spot at the beginning is the one you were talking about Yeah, the people who help us didn't put the box there in a timely fashion otherwise it would have gotten that right Yeah, so that's the one day chart. So yeah, so they were lower they've rallied and Did you sell a vertical spread?

We can go to your screen later on Nick when we go to make a trade But let's just go to your portfolio That is your full portfolio. You're short a Costco 145 call and you're short a Costco 135 put and it looks like you're up about Today you're up about $14 and change on the overall trade I think you're up around 20 some of ours is hard for me to see on the on the overall trade.

No, no you can There we go You know go to the upper right there and make it Yes, thanks click on it. All right. So you got $265 in extrinsic value you sold the call at 217 I think you sold to put it 70 cents 60 69 69 cents you got two eight six and it's trading for $265 So you've got yourself 21 bucks in profit not bad with the stock not going in the direction you want yet Still have a high probability of trade anything over 50 50 we consider high probability trade You're probably a profit on this overall trade is 62 bucks. What has helped you on on this overall trade Let's go to let's just go to the trade page and click on Costco Do you remember what the ivy rank was in Costco when you put on your first trade ever?

I believe it was a trade to make sure I'm Monday Friday Friday blessed So we made the trade on Monday was the put that was money was put there we so the put we sold with the stock higher than where it is Now so stocks gone lower the puts lost money But the stocks gone higher the calls lost money. That's a perfect storm for us Now we want the stocks just to kind of sit here Contract a little bit and we set a reasonable expectation of about a dollar a little bit over a dollar over a dollar our original credit Received 50% of our original credit received 217 around a dollar dollar five dollar eight dollar ten anywhere in there 95 cents anywhere in there is it would be an acceptable Place to close it. Let me give you one more little secret or a little bit of trade hack or something like that That should typically happen on average in about 20 days after you put on the trade if you're placing these trades around 45 days to expiration that's just the way the numbers work out if it works out it's about 20 days from now Is that just a general ruler is that based on?

I mean, I know you're gonna take my word for it because I'm your father But you know somebody else out there might not you know believes I say the truth all the time all right so Emanuele S&P is done four dollars and 50 cents this becomes a part of market awareness Do you know what the Emanuele S&P's? That's the S&P 500. That's what would all fun managers or like like like like When I was a kid people would say what's the Dow doing? No way would said like what are what's the S&P 500 doing? As the market matured everything became you know, what's the market doing? They still quote the Dow they still talk about the Dow But anybody in the business or in the know who or anybody who does their own investing They always want to know what the S&P 500 is doing because 500 stocks 500 most capitalized stocks is a better indication of what the overall market is doing than a select 30 And then having the or the the big wide range of of everything Now, you know that that would skew it more than than the 500 top 100% it's you know so funny because Everything we talk about is how We need number of occurrences S&P 500 versus the Dow 30 so you want when you're trading you want a number of occurrences You want to put on as many trades you can to have a flatter skew meaning You know one goes higher one goes a little bit lower and everything kind of you hope everything kind of works out for itself All right, so you've got one trade on so that's like Micro managing a position meaning you know, I'm gonna put on one thing I'm gonna find the best trade and I'm a sit and watch or they like you could drive yourself nuts because you were doing that right I got the itch right now I'm like oh gotta put on a couple more. This is that's exactly what you said to me Yesterday when we're on the show you were talking about like let's do a vertical spread what haven't even told you what a vertical spread is or at least I know you're working here at tasty trade And I know everybody out there who's watching this has watched other segments So they know what a vertical spread is but it's always good to go back to the basics And let me give you the setup for what we want for a vertical spread so let's go Let's go into do we use we use a screen that we have up there and then we'll get to your Screen for you to place the trade Let's just go into the just because they can draw the arrows on here. It's a little bit easier for me. Yeah, let's get out of this and go to The the tiles on the left hand side called the grid And this is what I do every day. I'm looking for a trade. I'm looking to sell sell the first thing I want to do is sell Valtili so I'm looking for high implied volatility so click on the funnel Get rid of all the excluding earnings Let's go to 37 days to expiration You can do zero to you can do 50 to 100 first if you want to it doesn't matter me So we're looking for an IV rank around 50 to 100 and then change that from zero to 120 down to 37 now you have it right already Otherwise zero to 37 for the earnings because we want to take those out of our range because we don't we don't want the earnings to occur Before that expiration or right on the expiration could have said better myself and then click off of that and We don't have a big and if you remember on Friday we had about Three or four rows of stocks to pick from today. We only have five. So what does that tell you volatility is doing? It's probably going lower. I mean, there's not a lot of stocks that have high volatility Perfect it's contracting. I just want to make sure that you get it. I'm messing the same question That's what make sure that you're getting it. I see the same question in a different way Okay, so of all the stocks up there for reasons that we'll go into it another day Greek the first one FXC and Asher. I'm gonna throw them out Greek is a is a ten-dollar stock markets are a little bit wide in there. I don't have a problem with you Trading that stock, but I'm a little bit of a of a bull on a dip Meaning that I want to buy that stock As the stocks going lower we call that buying into weakness. I like to buy something when it's going a little bit lower I like to sell something when it's going a little bit lower previously I like to sell something when it's huddle more momentum move or going a little bit higher I like to sell into strength so I like to sell something that's going a little bit higher I like to buy into weakness to buy something when it's going a little bit lower Why I think I'm getting it at a discount and I think I'm selling it at a premium I don't know if it's going to go higher or lower, but that's just my thinking. Always in a contrarian role. And I hope that you developed that same type of style. Okay. Next thing that we have up there is TLT. Now TLT are bonds that's what you want to trade yesterday. If we're looking for high implied volatility, everything being relative, that's the highest most, highest implied volatility, most liquid product that we have on the board. So we should have a position in there. Now let's hold on a minute. If you look at the tile, it says it's up $1.36. It's a big movement today. Big movement up. So I must owe you some money because you want to sell a put spread in there. So you did good. Okay. So now what are we going to do? Since we've had a big move up of around 1%, a little over 1% on the stock, let's look at selling a put spread like you wanted to, which is a bullish strategy. And since the stock's ran up already, let's sell a call spread too. Also, together, it's called an iron condor. It's two vertical spreads of vertical spread and a credit spread are exactly the same thing. It's like saying six of one, half dozen of another. Vertical spread, credit spread, same exact thing. Make sense? Make sense. Debate spread is buying the spread. Credit spread is selling the spread. We're going to sell two vertical credit spreads. We're going to sell a call spread and we're going to sell a put spread. We're going to make the same type of risk graph that you have in Costco. We're going to do it all with one click and we're going to use a lot less buying power. Okay. Let's get off of this screen for a moment and let's get to your own screen and put in TLT for me. So we forget about Costco for now. We leave that on. We already know how we're going to get out of the trade. You could certainly go there and do you have something in there, right? What is that? Hold on. What do you got? No, that was just. So clear it on the right hand side dish. Should everybody do that? Okay. Beautiful. So Do does a great job of setting us up at a one standard deviation. Let me let me let's show you what Do does and then let's see how we can modify it to fit our own entry criteria. Remember the only thing that we can control is entry. So that's number of contracts and what strategy we pick. We're picking a high implied volatility stock, high IV rank. So that means we're selling premium. Let's go and click on strategy for me. And then we're going to go down to iron condor. Now before you click on anything else, look at what the box does right in there. It shows you a risk graph of the strategy that you're going to do. Like if you didn't have somebody talking to you and telling you what an iron condor is, if you looked at that risk graph, you're selling a call selling a put that's closer at the money and you're buying a call and buying a put that's further out of the money to define your risk. Okay. So we want to do a normal iron condor. That's the top one. Go to your advanced settings for a moment. Okay. So expiration 15 days. This is our optimal time to get into a trade. 45. So let's put 45 in there and see what happens. Do we like to trade weekly options or monthly options? Monthly is what we prefer. So get rid of the weeklies. You don't have to have that on there now. If you want to do a weekly trade someday, we'll look at it. Click on one standard deviation. Okay. Well, with the strikes. Now here, this is an interesting thing about an iron condor as opposed to a vertical spread. And I would have loved to have done a vertical spread today, but markets just don't permit us to do that. Meaning you were bullish on the spread the time you were bullish on the stock. The time to do it was yesterday when you wanted to. Let's not make sense to do that. Same. Well, I don't know if it's going to go higher, but it just had a 1% move. It's not the type of product that has that large of a move typically. Although it's been very volatile lately. So maybe we'll just play the movement back and forth. Okay. Total widths. So if I'm risking, if I define your maximum risk, because you see how it says it on the right hand side. So if I went $1 wide, I have $100 worth of risk. If I did a $2 wide, I have $2 worth of risk. $5 wide, I did a $5 worth of risk. How wide do you want to go? I mean, it depends on what kind of credit I'm getting is how I would. Okay. So as a new trader, that's a pretty good answer. And it's a fair answer, and it's not a wrong answer. I'll give you what we've, I've given you what we found so that you have good rules or at least good guidelines, $3. $3 wide iron condors with around 45 days to go to expiration seems to be the best risk reward from our research. So let's start with $3. All right. $3. And click go. Okay, so I brought you to August with 37 days, which is perfect. It's got you see those two white lines there right about where your two short strikes are. That's a one standard deviation move. 85% of the time, the stock stays inside that one standard, excuse me, around 75% of the time, the stock stays inside, that's really 68%. 68% of the time, the stock stays inside that one standard deviation range. What's your credit received? 56 cents. Okay. 56 dollars. So we have a little bit of a rule here. We like to collect around one third of the width of the strikes. Okay. So one third of the width of a $3 wide strike would be around $1. So let's tighten up our widths. Okay, now stop for a moment. We've got about a dollar, about one third of the width of the strikes. Look at the prices on the call that you're selling. 66 cents. And look at the price of the put that you're selling. A dollar two. Do you see that? Yeah. Now they're both about, well let's see, 17 and a half to 22. You're about five down, you're a little bit closer on the put side, correct? Makes sense? Let's just take that put side down a little bit. And then move the call side down a little bit. So stay right there. Just move all the strikes, all the width to the left. Well, that way. Thanks. Okay, perfect. So now we went from a one standard deviation range. Now we moved it into kind of almost equal. Does it make sense? You're trading for around the same price that you're calls trading for. It's still $3 wide. You're getting around that 90 cents. Let's route this one time at 89 cents. You're probably going to have to move it by a penny or two to get filled. But we'll leave it right now the way it is. Okay. Let's try to review a little bit about what we talked about today. Okay. And tomorrow I'll go over more of what an iron condor is and all of the benefits of why you should do a condor possibly over the directional. The directional aspect of a vertical spread are the trade that you put on had a, had a 58% probability of success. We can say that a high probability trade because it's anything over 50%. A vertical spread is a simultaneous purchase and sale of two options. Same type, same expiration dates, but different strike prices. Same type meaning both calls or both puts. In your case, you did two vertical spreads. You did two vertical credit spreads at the same time to make an iron condor. You okay? Mm-hmm. You're fine with it? Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. Who comes up next? Tonight. A rerun of 10, right? We're on for the seven times. We're going live? Oh, last call. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Never mind. Last call. I'm still on duty. Too nice back tomorrow. Too nice back tomorrow. Peace.

Transcript:  That versus bat, where do I start? What's up my friend? How are you? Got my red on today trying to uh... Yeah, I'm trying to earn some brownie points with the ladies, listen Jenny, I mean come on. If the apple isn't falling far from the tree, that's my son sitting over there. So red shirt, red shirt Thursday, you put on a red shirt because you think you got a shot? I'll take my chances, I mean, that's good. That's good. Okay, okay. I wasn't able to crack that egg, but okay. Sounds good to me. Good for you. How's your day going? It's going well. It's been a little slower day today, but uh... it's been good. Okay, good. Good. And that's what... so how do you quantify a good day? I mean, a little slower, support wise. Okay, so we're a little bit slower support, but how do you quantify a good day? What made you a good day? Oh, well, in this, make money. Oh, okay. Making it, but at least going my direction or staying. I think you're actually making some money. Let's put your... you know what, let's... how about this? Let's use the other computer first, not yours, just because we can put some circles around some of the things and then we can look at it. So, yeah, put a circle. You're up $37.50. I mean, that was the right answer. For me, a good day and a bad day starts with how my trading account is doing. You're not doing it having a good day, right? Yeah. This is how this is going to go, huh? Yeah, today's a rough day for me. Yeah, today's a rough day. I got a little... got a little too large in Netflix. If I had traded my normal size, it would have just been, you know, a lousy day. I got a little too big. Size kills. Talk about it with you. You know, stay in mechanical, understanding what, you know, what the risks are. Keep you a number of occurrences up. You only have two number of occurrences. I have my number of occurrences up in my own account. But yeah, I broke the rules. Thought I saw something. Genius fails. Thought I saw something that was going to be great. I'm going to work it. I want to make it right. You're going to... you're just like you were working in Costco. Not adding to your position, but selling the put against the call you're making it work. So I'm going to do the same thing. But the first day, it's not a great feeling. You're not going to lie. No. You'll experience it someday. God willing you will. Yeah. Because you have to come in this business, any business. If you're opening up a convenience store in the corner, you know there are going to be days. And probably months when you know you don't make your knot or the customers don't come in or they go next door. Or you, you know, you zig when you should zag, you zig when you should zig. It happens. So far you're doing okay in both of your your your trades. TLT was one and Costco was the other. It looks like you're up around $12 for the day and you're up $38 total. On around $3,500 in overall risk in your account that you have. So you've made 1% or so or a tenth of a percent or so over the last couple of days. Pretty good. Okay. So what do you got from your day? What what do you bullish on? Today I wanted to look into since we always talk about gambling and my affinity for it. I wanted to go at L LVS at Las Vegas Sands Las Vegas Sands. Okay. All right. And so. So what's the what's the IVR in Las Vegas Sands the IVR rank? It's at 65. Okay. So definitely hits our range. Looking for high implied volatility that that works, right? When did this have earnings? I believe it was yesterday. See I don't know because we didn't if we click the E. Okay. At the top it'll give us a little drop down. So yeah. So it had earnings just yesterday that minus one days over the size. Okay. Okay. All right. So all right. So what do you what do you look at when you? Or so you bullish on it doesn't doesn't matter. It doesn't matter to me. Why? I mean doesn't matter me why or what? If I were to look at this stock let's just go to a chart of it real quick. Just to see where it's just to see where it's been. Nothing else than a visual of the last 30 days. Okay. So for the last 30 days or so it seems like it's about mid range. It's had a big drop off. Listen. I'm not reading into any of this. I don't trade Las Vegas Sands that much. We trade it. We trade it sometimes. Come on Anton. I think they're the 22nd. Okay. I thought so too because implied volatility is 48% 42% with July and eight days. So that's wrong on there. Want one shoot. Well the next thing I was going to do for you was close out there for a moment and let's see. Close up August and let's see the implied volatility on. It's not that it's not that great there. Let's see what eight days to go. Do you not have the weeklies up there? It has one day 36 days. Doesn't have any of the weekly. Let's change that. Thank you. Okay. There you go. Okay. So you see the eight day with that star there showing a high implied volatility of 45%. And then it slowly goes down to 413736. That kind of tells me that something's going to happen in that July expiration just because of a little bit higher. All right. All right. So could we back can we backtrack then? Okay. Since you made fun of me in Netflix. How about you get involved in Netflix? All right. Okay. But I want you to get involved with a debit spread. Okay. So yesterday we talked about a credit spread. Time flies. Yesterday we talked about a credit spread. What's a credit spread? Credit spread is when we are taking in credit for the trade. Okay. So it's the simultaneous buy and sell of two options to different options in the same month. You're selling a larger option and you're buying a smaller option to create a credit. A debit spread is exactly the opposite. You're buying an option that has it's higher in value say $5 and selling another option that has a lower value. Let's just say $3 and you're creating a debit. I paid five. I sold something at three. I'm creating a debit of two bucks. My risk then is $2 to find risk trade just like the credit spread. So you can use the same strikes and have a debit spread would be buying it and a credit spread would be selling it. Does it make sense? Okay. So Netflix up $17.90 everybody loves Netflix today. $8 expected move. It's two times the expected move. Presplit which was just yesterday. That's a well over $105 move on the stock. When it should only move about 50 bucks or so, 55 bucks. Tremendous move. Let's go to August. Put on a debit spread and let's just assume for a moment and I'm not bullish. Let's just assume for a moment you were bullish. If we were going to do a debit spread, we might look to buy an option that's one strike or two strikes or three strikes in the money and sell an option that's one strike two strikes or three strikes out in the money. Now these strikes are going to be a little bit messed up because you've got all these funky numbers to them. Let's do the 1520 call spread stock is 16 and change when we just stay on your computer just because we're there right now. Go to strategies, go to vertical, go to long call. So we're buying the 1520 call spread and it looks like it's trading for if we look on the right. Yeah, you're going to have to move them probably manually because he's just double clicking on it, clicking X and then you can click on selling. There you go. And what's a trading for $2.30? $2.30. We like to create a debit spread where we are paying no extrinsic value over the stock price. Can you so circle the stock price of 16, $1,16 and 17 cents? Okay. If I paid $2,030 for the spread, am I paying any extrinsic value over the price of the stock? You would be. Why? Because the right answer. The buy is below the strike or is below the current price and it's only $1.17. So you're paying $1.13 or what were we at? Perfect. It's the right answer. 100%. That's awesome. See now you understand spreads like you understand a credit and debit spread by that answer. By being able to answer that, you understand all vertical spreads. We want to create a spread where we would be paying a guess for that $5 wide spread where we're paying around $1.17 because then we wouldn't have any extrinsic value over the stock. That's awesome. Okay. Let's just take a quick look at what we talked about today or at least tried to talk about it. I know we got a little bit off track here. You can get off of your screen. Perfect. So a debit spread and I got this right from our glossary. If you go to the bottom of the tasty trade site, you can get these right yourself and see these. And there's a whole bunch of other terminologies that we have up there. A debit spread is just a spread that when it opens results in money being debited from your account. When we look to buy a debit spread, we don't look at what the delta is on the spread. We don't look at any of the strikes. We look at as a 50-50 probability with defined risk and we look to pay no extrinsic value or very little extrinsic value over the stock. A credit spread is exactly the opposite. It's a spread that when open results in a credit in your account and we like to collect how much? What percentage of the width of the strikes? 1-3. 1-3. That's it. Nothing else. Tomorrow we'll try to combine those. You don't have to put the card up. Tomorrow we'll try to combine those. If you combine a debit spread with a credit spread, you can create a butterfly. And then if you get really fancy, you can create a broken-wing butterfly. Which we'll do tomorrow in Netflix. Sound good? Cool. All right. Good job out of you. Tim Knight's next. He's live. I think for the first time, right? Yes. Good to be awesome. What do I normally say? Good job, son. Thanks.

Oh, well, in this, make money. Oh, okay. Making it, but at least going my direction or staying. I think you're actually making some money. Let's put your... you know what, let's... how about this?

See now you understand spreads like you understand a credit and debit spread by that answer. By being able to answer that, you understand all vertical spreads. We want to create a spread where we would be paying a guess for that $5 wide spread where we're paying around $1.17 because then we wouldn't have any extrinsic value over the stock. That's awesome. Okay. Let's just take a quick look at what we talked about today or at least tried to talk about it. I know we got a little bit off track here. You can get off of your screen. Perfect. So a debit spread and I got this right from our glossary. If you go to the bottom of the tasty trade site, you can get these right yourself and see these. And there's a whole bunch of other terminologies that we have up there. A debit spread is just a spread that when it opens results in money being debited from your account. When we look to buy a debit spread, we don't look at what the delta is on the spread. We don't look at any of the strikes. We look at as a 50-50 probability with defined risk and we look to pay no extrinsic value or very little extrinsic value over the stock. A credit spread is exactly the opposite. It's a spread that when open results in a credit in your account and we like to collect how much? What percentage of the width of the strikes? 1-3. 1-3. That's it. Nothing else. Tomorrow we'll try to combine those. You don't have to put the card up. Tomorrow we'll try to combine those. If you combine a debit spread with a credit spread, you can create a butterfly. And then if you get really fancy, you can create a broken-wing butterfly. Which we'll do tomorrow in Netflix. Sound good? Cool. All right. Good job out of you. Tim Knight's next. He's live. I think for the first time, right? Yes. Good to be awesome. What do I normally say? Good job, son. Thanks.

Transcript:  I Make it we're back Where do I start back first back back to bat how are you good? How are you good everything all right? Yeah? It's good. It's Friday. Can't be too uh too unhappy. I saw you in the makeup room getting makeup put on Take a pictures and everything like that. Was that you yeah, you got to look good come on. You didn't have any makeup I'm just teasing you. You days, okay? Yeah, all right my positions are kind of um, I've got a Close touch close to being a touch on my Costco call that I sold Okay, 45, but I still got time on it, so okay, so does it concern you all? All my mean of course it's a little bit uh concerning, but I I'll keep I'll keep the time and and deal with it, you know if it gets any closer or worse all right Well, let's put your account up distance you mentioned it But I really want to talk about and get a trade put on for you in a butterfly, but we'll mention it Go to um, that's your screen right neck. Yeah, okay. Let's go to Open up the trade just so we could see what the strike so that's perfect So you shut the 145 call stocks right about 145 will just round up But you sold that call for $2.17. So your break even is is what? Um Plus 217 on top of 147 17 plus the 60 cents that you sold for the put brings you up to 147 You know 77 it's called 147 80 correct, okay, so yeah Remember something We'd never discussed this, but if you sell an option would a 30% which is about the range that we always go into 30 35 25% So we're in that that range if you sell an option with a 30% probability of being Uh, in the money. What do you think the probability of a touches like what do you think the probability of a stock in that time frame touching your short strike? Like what portion of that percentage or just overall overall if there's a 30% chance That it's gonna be in the money. What's the probability of a touch? It's double So it's a there's a there's a 60% chance that the stock is gonna hit that strike So when you sell a call you sell a put bullish or bearish it doesn't matter to me Your strike Is more than likely going to be tested that doesn't mean the trade has to be a losing trade Your put your call looks like it's trading it around 229 229 so it is a small loser because you just sold it four or five days ago The stock hasn't had a down-ticks that you sold it yeah, but yet the overall position has a gain to it But let's need a here and there when you sold that call if it had a 35 delta There's about a 70% chance. It's gonna be gonna be a touch of that strike So it's it's it's a foregone conclusion that that's probably gonna happen Does that make sense yeah, all right cool So keep that in mind for a moment because I want to show you something It's your computer. So let's go to let's go to you Let's go to let's go to Netflix. Let's go on the trade page Are you really are concerned about this Costco because you've been you have it up there on the screen It's the last thing you checked okay. What do you have up there? um I've got a short call butterfly Short call butterfly and possibly just get out of that. I'm not I'm not yeah, that's okay. Click on straight stop Believe what you have there. I you cleared it. All right Yeah, stop stop stop stop clicking around you get more crazy Click on the strategies to release that up on the top left. There you go. Okay now stop now go to the right there on your screen And you see where it says undo on the top top right right there go to the left. There you go Stop that button allows you to click back and forth to what you used to have on in your platform So if you move something you like it and then all of a sudden you know you don't like it anymore You can go back and forth and change the strikes. We have it. Okay, and other way you could do like a redo too You can you can redo right and go back very good all right, so All right, so I see things here that I don't like I'm gonna tell you why First you have a butterfly strategy up there, which is great We never sell butterflies That's a that's a short butterfly we only buy butterflies they trade very very cheap They Probability of success Which means if you sold them like you want to do here it has a very high probability of success But the risk reward Isn't that great meaning you could make 45 cents in the spread that you have up there it looks like you can lose around $3 Is that correct for yeah for with $3 Yeah, three 12 okay So we don't do that all right We buy butterflies and we buy butterflies Typically when there's a high implied volatility Why do you think we would buy butterflies in a high implied volatility Um Because they're the markets expecting a price move in the In the other line that's awesome and since they they this is great Since they since they expect a large window of movement they trade cheaper Said does that make does that make sense because nobody they're dependent flip that over if you could um Make it a buy You can just To a long call yeah, okay, that's fine however you did it at a little time You like clicking around on the button, so yeah, you're really like a new toy for you, huh Now you're in the wrong month you were in the you were in the 42 days before yeah, so here I'm at 42 days here Okay, I don't think that's the same when you had up there, but it doesn't matter me. Oh, I'd yeah My man, it's okay. You know, you know what you could have done Right what you could have just oh yeah, I could have done my him my undo. Yeah, you could have done your undo You could have you could have flipped them over there on the on the swap see up on top there right there oops go click it They see it changes it from by itself A lot less clicks, but you know you you know you young kids with your with your games you like to click around Try on air try on air okay, but now you learn you really see introduced you remember the the swap button Okay, so we always buy butterflies a butterfly is the combination of a long call spread Uh in the example you have up there is the 112 in change and you're selling You got to throw on flip now again. There you go Wow, I'm gonna think for for the next couple days we're gonna have somebody else drive for a while So so we can get something done here. All right, so you're buying a call spread That's the 112 in change call and selling the 115 you notice it's one by two by one. Do you see that two on the cell So you're buying one call spread and you're selling another call spread equal distance away I don't think you have equal distance away there, but that's that's neither here nor there. That's a classic butterfly All right, so you have 42 days up there We trade monthlies and I've told you this before so stop looking So anywhere else for a trade that's not in the monthlies the monthlies have 35 days to go You're trying to set it so that it doesn't uh Yeah, to show only uh the regular Explorations which they say working with your child is a gift Uh-huh All right, so how's this experiment working for you So I'm at um here I got the monthlies very good August 21. Okay, click them So now what do you have up there you can stay right we're at the table now now you got the table switch on around do you have ADD? I think you have ADD do you? all right, so So can I show you what we do? All right, so get rid of that one by that you have up there and you know what get rid of the whole Hold it get rid of the whole thing clear fresh. Thank you All right, all right, you can stay right where you are if you want to I want to click the buttons though. I know how you want to click the buttons All right, so remember I told you yesterday I showed you a spread that we didn't want to pay any extrinsic value over the Stock price Let's buy the 111 43 call so you can click on buying the 111 43 call Uh, okay, and now let's click on selling the 116 43 call It's gonna be down a little bit Right there Okay, now try to make it so that everybody can see what you're buying on the other stop right there Okay, so that spread is trading for about two dollars and 70 cents now. I know that the strikes are a little bit odd in there. So What's the Is there any extrinsic Value on that spread And you know how to figure it out $2.70 is what the price is mm-hmm, and you got amany use one 111 43 is the strike that you're buying Plus two seven day, right? Yes, that puts me at 114 $3.13 $13 $13.13 So that's Below what the current price is to us now change it to the curvy leave leave all the options and then just click on a curvy To us we consider that a 50 50 shot and that's exactly what the computer shows you it's a 50 50 shot You'll notice that your green line is below Where the stock price is trading at the green Uh, little teardrop there is where the stock is trading at so to us that's basically a 50 50 shot That's a stock substitution for us. So I'm only risking $270 To make just about $200 and change click review and send one time So you so you're risking $270 to make $230 We're doing a call vertical here though. That's a call vertical And I'm not really necessarily bullish on Netflix, but I but I want to and I'm actually bearish but get rid of that So click the X on the top right Either way Perfect. Okay, go back to the table view All right, so now I want to add remember I told you a butterfly is a long call spread there's a long call spread And the combination of a short call spread So make that short call that you have the one 1643s make it two contracts All right, uh, you have to You have to click it. Okay Now we're going to buy something if we were doing a regular butterfly We'd have to buy something five dollars away because that spread is five dollars wide correct from the first call From the daughter call that we're buying five From there or from the one that we're selling From the one that you're selling why because the one that you're buying is five dollars away from the one you're selling Okay, so it's gonna make ten points It's gonna be ten dollars wide, but we call that a five dollar wide butterfly Okay, okay, because it's your short strike where do you want the stock to go Stay there you want to stay in the range you want the stock to go right to your short strike Just about every strategy we do you want the stock to go to your short strike For the sake of time because we're running out of it If I wanted to buy a regular butterfly I would buy the next call five dollars out of the money Okay, I want you to buy the call that's ten dollars out of the money So go to the one 26 43 call And you had to click on buy Perfect you Perfect, you're good. Yeah, I'm good. You're good. What do we paint go back to the curve view for a moment? Uh, that says debit change the debit to a credit I can Give it a second to refresh if it will Okay, go back You just have to you have to click it or make it zero or something like that you get to here. Yeah There we go. No You're fine perfect leave it like that just leave like that. It's got a one-cent credit perfect Okay, what I want to show you is that was a three-cent debit so you have risk on both sides But your risk on one side all the way to the downside was only three cents three dollars Here if you do it for a credit your risk to the downside is zero So you go from a 50 50 shot to a 70 30 shot your way you still want the stock to paint at your short strike Because that's where you'll make the most money, but you make money all the way down I want you to find a butterfly spread That you're buying one side five dollars selling another side ten dollars where your call is out of the money And you're able to do it for a credit that's your homework assignment then make the trade and push it through because I got other shows to do all right Let's try to let's try to go over Uh, can I push this or no that doesn't meet your criteria. I said you're gonna find your own strikes I said you said you go out like I said push this one through and then find another one I need You're one lot Johnny trader. You don't trade two lots one lot All right, you're four days in for crying out loud You can read up there what a butterfly spread is you should probably go over the segment again Because I don't think you'll pay attention you're clicking around too much You see what a butterfly spread is a broken wing butterfly spread is just making that uh shorter side wider To finance and I hate that word but to finance what you're paying for the for the five dollar wide original Spread and that spread could be any with doesn't have to be five dollars where this is I'm using for Netflix Okay, where's your risk on that trade? Um, to either either on this one or like in general Not a broken wing who cares about the bottom of the upside if it goes bullish perfect So where do you want to start to go down or stay the same very good I'm hard working with you. It's tough working with him too What do we say till next peace

Transcript:  What do I start? Bat vs. Bat. How are you, my man? Well, thanks. Have a nice weekend and see you this weekend. I did. I was at a wedding. I had some fun. Good. High school friends, old college friends, aerosus. It was a good time. Good time. That's why I didn't see you on Sunday. I figured you were. Yes, yes. Sunday was Saturday. Day of rest for me. Day of rest. I think you sent me a text message and said, you're not getting off the couch. Something like that. Yeah, I was feeling hurt. Yeah. So you're maturing, but you're not there yet. Not there yet. Got it. Got it. Okay, so enough chitchat. Make up for the weekend and we didn't see each other. Okay, so what's the market doing to your account? It's been good. I mean, it's all my positions have looked okay. So what's the market doing? Look, I mean, well, I know what the market's doing every day. So you handle some things. Hold on, you handle support. It takes the trade, right? Talk to customers all day long. You're supposed to be instrumental on what's going on with Do. I ask you, what's the market doing? And you got to look. Yeah. You may as up five points, five and a half. For every been all day. Thinking up around five points, right? Okay, where's the overall market? High, low, medium, extreme in market for what? You're a trader. You tell me. Yeah. I mean, so what's the market mean to you? Let's put a chart up of SPY that's standing in ports 500. So let's just take a look at the S&P 500. SPY's been down. No. No. There you have it. You got to get you away from your mother. What's what's what is SPY done? Well, it's like it's unchanged over the last 30 days. That's a that's a you know, that's a six. That's a six month chart. Basically a year to date. So we're up. If you look on the left hand side, this is what I want you to have set up on your charts. So if you look on the left hand side, the IV rank, 2.3%. That's extremely low. Do you see it in right on the left? Okay. Price change up 4.4%. That's in the last 10 days. If you you shouldn't know how to do this and you shouldn't have to put on your own charts so that you can see what's going on. So you have this in your. So if I ask like, what's going on with the market? Yeah, you're right. Like, I don't know. Tell me what in what time frame? What do you what do you mean? What's going on with the market? We're at all time highs. That's that's a given. What's the market been doing recently? Well, I mean, I guess you could say if you if you discount the last 10 days, we've been going we were we were starting to go a little bit lower. But now we've come back, right? So you've got markets at all time highs. You've only got three positions on. We want to have a lot more positions on. But we're trying to go slow yet fast. Is this a market extreme? I don't think so. I mean, why? I mean, it's an opinion. I don't know what is it. Do you know what? I have one more homework because I'm a for you. Can you handle it? I need you to Google search when you don't want to show market extremes or the definition of market extremes. I dare you to find the definition of market extremes because they don't quantify it. Nobody talks about it. Well, and aren't there many different markets? I mean, if I said what are the market extremes for a specific stock or for commodities or for, I mean, aren't they, are they all together as one or king and consider them separate? You played football out when you were growing up, right? If you missed, played defense offense, you played both, right? If you missed two plays in ten plays, would that be a market extreme? No. Why aren't you in on every play? If you missed two, would that be extreme? Yes. If you missed one, would that be extreme? Yes. Well, you can't win without your best player on the field. Well, it's a good thing you follow as a coach. Anyway, I understand. What I'm trying to say here is you have to quantify it somehow. You have to say something. Like, you have to put it into perspective so that every time. So we look at ten days. If the markets moved 5% or more typically between 5% and 10% in a 10-day period, that's that number on the left hand side where you look at an SPY of 4%, we say that that's kind of a market extreme or something for us to look at. That's not my point. So we're getting there now. We aren't getting there on the market. Let's look at GLD for a moment. We have low implied volatility in SPY. Okay, so now GLD, 52% IV rank. Higher IV rank gives us a lot more things that we can trade. So this is at an extreme too. It's moved 5, 5 dollars and 44 cents. 5.4%. Not dollars. Yes, 100%. So if I asked you, is GLD at an extreme the way we quantify it, you might say, yeah, it is. It's actually at a five-year lower, around a four-year lower, something like that. That fact means nothing to me. Because I deal in a 45, 30 to 45 to 60, 45 days being the perfect range. So for me, I wonder what's going on right now. How many downs have you missed this game? I don't care for the last three years how many you missed. I'm looking right now and I want to see right now. So GLD in my eyes is at a market extreme. Okay, let's go to your account. We'll just stay right in the place that we're at. Okay, so you've got an overall probability of profit on your account of 72%. That's high and that's good, especially in this market condition that we're in. But we only have three positions on. Let's be fair. And you've got a small amount of, well listen, everything is relative, but you have $300, $325 in extrinsic value to make this month on your overall position. Okay, did you know that you can click on each individual position to see, to see the risk graph on each one? Let's take a look at that. Unclick all of them and just click on Costco. Okay, so if you click on Costco, it gives you a risk graph. So you don't have to know anything about options here, but you could tell if that white circle is where the stock is right now and green is good and red is bad. The more it increases the risk of gets for that trade. In that trade. Let's unclick Costco and look at Netflix. Now that first position that you have in Costco is an iron condor. Well, it's a, is a strangle. Yeah, this one you have on is a, you know what it is? This is our butterfly. Butterflies actually a broken wing butterfly. Perfect, because we did it for a $1 credit. One Sank credits, so it cuts out the risk below the lowest strike points. That's correct. You have no risk to one side. And you just, you just did a, you did a good trade a term for a moment there. Like you said $1 and then you corrected it to $1. In our world, $1 is $1. If you told me you did this for a $1 credit, I would think you did it for $100 credit. So this is just a big difference. Big difference. But as you start learning the terminology and everybody else starts learning the terminology out there, they'll start doing the same thing. Okay, this one in Netflix, although you have no risk to the downside, you wouldn't mind if it went up $1 or $2 or $3 in the next, you know, 30 some odd days. That's unclick Netflix and go to TLT. Okay, TLT, you have an iron condor on equal risk on both sides, stocks right in the middle. Okay, nothing. So you're a whole account, you know, for what it's worth, neutral, neutral. You're a whole position, click them all for me for a moment, because it's going to make it well. There you go. You're up around $49.50, so since we started last week, and it looks like you're up about $28 today. Not bad. Yeah. On $4,000 worth of risk. I don't know, it's a pretty good rate of return. Yeah. You were in the business for a while, that's pretty good. Yeah. Okay, but we haven't booked anything, so it doesn't matter. All right, let's go back to what our market, what we feel is a market extreme the way we quantify it, and the way we present it. Let's go into GLD, we'll go to the Trade tab. Okay, so the first thing that we want to do is we want to be in the August monthlies, that's the one that we always go to, and that's what we have there. We like monthly options, I shouldn't say, always August. Always the monthly options. Around 20 to 25 days, it's going to be the last time that we would put on a trade in that front month. We probably look to the back month after that. Okay, what kind of trade do you want to put on in GLD? You have a broken wing butterfly, you have a strangle on, and you have an iron condor. So let's go... Bullish or bearish? Let's go bullish on gold. Okay, because you have to have an opinion, right? Yeah. You can have a neutral position, but you have to have a position. Okay, so what do you want to do? Let's go with some, let's get long, a long call vertical maybe, or... Okay, so hold on a second. What do we have? High implied volatility, a low implied volatility. We have high implied volatility. High V rank, so long call spread. You know, it doesn't fit there. Yeah, you don't want to be buying. Right. So we could do, I mean, we could do a short put spread. Perfect, stop right there. Don't complicate it. Let's do a short put spread. Let's go to the curve view, just for them, just for everybody to look for a moment. Then we're going to come back here. All right, so the put spread that we're selling is the, that they have up there is a 104-102. It's got about a 64, 65% probability of success. What do we like to collect on a vertical spread? The extrinsic. We want to make sure that it's... We're always going to collect the extrinsic because we're selling something. We're always going to sell something out of the money, which means it's worth nothing if today was expiration. It's worth whatever it's trading for. A third of the width of the strikes. Perfect. Do you have a third here? Do we go from the price or the price? Or the two strikes that were... So you have a $2 wide put spread. You'd want to collect one third with the strikes, which is approximately... 75 cents. 65 cents. 66. Right. So do you get 66 cents here? Again, 51 there. So you got to move it up. So move up the put side. There you go. 64. Now you have 78 cents, correct? So that would work, right? That would work. Let's go down half a strike for a moment. Five and a half. There you go. And then three and a half. Five and a half. Five and a half, three and a half gives us 70 cents. Closest to one third. That's all I'm looking for. All right. So, and I'm running out of time and I do apologize. I want to throw a monkey wrench in this for you. Instead of just doing a short vertical spread, because Costco, you were bearish on, and the stock hasn't had a down tick. Yeah, since you put it on. Our hedge that we did is making all the money. You're directionally, you've been wrong for the last week. So I'm going to assume that you have that same type of mentality. So we're going to hedge up bet. I think you're ultimately going to be right in Costco. And I'm bearish on Costco. And I'm losing money in Costco. You're actually making money in Costco. So you're doing better than me. But our assumptions haven't been good on direction. So let's get smart and strategic. Let's put on a $1 wide call spread on top of this. Let's sell the 108109 call spread. It's not going to cost us any more buying power while you put that on if you could. If you want to go to the table view, you can make it easier for you. Okay. He's going to put in the 108109 call spread. So what we're doing here is we have $2 worth of risk. We collect 70 cents for argument 6. Our buying power reduction is going to be $130. By selling this call spread, since the stock can't close at expiration above the calls and below the puts, it has to close only at one price. You're not getting margined on both sides. So instead of having $130, you're collecting almost $102 here. Your buying power reduction would be $98. That would be a lot less. It would be a lot less. Probably getting to 108 is 35%. But you're collecting a dollar. So your break even is actually over 109. Go back to the curve view. You have no risk to the upside. And you're collecting another 30 cents. Makes sense? So it's still a bullish strategy. We don't make as much money to the upside. We have a smaller window. But we're going to have a chance to manage just at a 50% probability of success a little bit quicker. In my eyes. Okay. Sounds good. I'm running late. Let's just go over what we talked about here a little bit. We talked about market extremes. And how we quantify them. We looked at an iron condor that you did on Monday or Tuesday in your in your in your one of your original shows. And we did a skewed iron condor today. It's the same as an iron condor. It's just one side is wider. In this instance, we have a $2 wide put spread versus a $1 wide call spread, which makes it a little bit of a bullish strategy. We typically like to collect more than our risk on that one side, which is a dollar. Okay. All right. You got to try to get filled on this on this spread. Don't worry about stock keeps down taking. So you'll be fine. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. What do I normally say? Peace. Peace on the work.

Transcript:  What do I start? Bat vs. Bat. How are you, my man? Well, thanks. Have a nice weekend and see you this weekend. I did. I was at a wedding. I had some fun. Good. High school friends, old college friends, aerosus. It was a good time. Good time. That's why I didn't see you on Sunday. I figured you were. Yes, yes. Sunday was Saturday. Day of rest for me. Day of rest. I think you sent me a text message and said, you're not getting off the couch. Something like that. Yeah, I was feeling hurt. Yeah. So you're maturing, but you're not there yet. Not there yet. Got it. Got it. Okay, so enough chitchat. Make up for the weekend and we didn't see each other. Okay, so what's the market doing to your account? It's been good. I mean, it's all my positions have looked okay. So what's the market doing? Look, I mean, well, I know what the market's doing every day. So you handle some things. Hold on, you handle support. It takes the trade, right? Talk to customers all day long. You're supposed to be instrumental on what's going on with Do. I ask you, what's the market doing? And you got to look. Yeah. You may as up five points, five and a half. For every been all day. Thinking up around five points, right? Okay, where's the overall market? High, low, medium, extreme in market for what? You're a trader. You tell me. Yeah. I mean, so what's the market mean to you? Let's put a chart up of SPY that's standing in ports 500. So let's just take a look at the S&P 500. SPY's been down. No. No. There you have it. You got to get you away from your mother. What's what's what is SPY done? Well, it's like it's unchanged over the last 30 days. That's a that's a you know, that's a six. That's a six month chart. Basically a year to date. So we're up. If you look on the left hand side, this is what I want you to have set up on your charts. So if you look on the left hand side, the IV rank, 2.3%. That's extremely low. Do you see it in right on the left? Okay. Price change up 4.4%. That's in the last 10 days. If you you shouldn't know how to do this and you shouldn't have to put on your own charts so that you can see what's going on. So you have this in your. So if I ask like, what's going on with the market? Yeah, you're right. Like, I don't know. Tell me what in what time frame? What do you what do you mean? What's going on with the market? We're at all time highs. That's that's a given. What's the market been doing recently? Well, I mean, I guess you could say if you if you discount the last 10 days, we've been going we were we were starting to go a little bit lower. But now we've come back, right? So you've got markets at all time highs. You've only got three positions on. We want to have a lot more positions on. But we're trying to go slow yet fast. Is this a market extreme? I don't think so.

Transcript:  I Mickey, where do I start that versus bat? You know, I didn't realize something every time we start this show There's this like big hands of picture of just you. I know How'd you work that out? Well, we got some pictures together coming soon. I think okay. All right good Well, gotta shoot a spotlight with me a little bit, right? Yeah. All right, so As we do every day After my show is over at 11 o'clock We do a show in the morning from 7 to 11 Tom Sazofa myself We have a little lunch and then you kind of come buzzing around and What do you always ask me? I give you the kind of the nudges like hey, hey, come on. What's plan? What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do and what I get I have the itch now So I got it you've been bit. Yeah, and since you're on for the first five hours I got to sit up and look at my portfolio page the whole time I can't put anything on I got weight I got weight so okay, I can understand that so let me backtrack for a moment Do you know how long it took me to make my first trade? Three years Why was that for three years? I worked at a job just like you're doing and Then saved enough money to open up a trading account saved enough money To buy a seat on the floor of the exchange Which actually somebody lent me the money to and up until that moment all I could do was paper trade like fake trade So you've been at this this is gonna be this is the first full week, right? I mean of actual trades. I think we made a first day on Monday we did last week Friday Friday the week prior but Friday the week last last last week was our first trading for a week Yeah, sometimes you just got to pump the brakes a little bit and Understand some of the products. So what you did to me today was you came up to me said You know what there's not a lot to trade you have a lot more technology than I ever had like I was Subjected just a few stocks that I that I was able to trade on the floor of the CBOE you have access to everything And I know you go through the dough platform and you you go to the high and volatility You want to do that for me if you if you don't mind Nikki you don't have to do it with the other screen for a moment and you go through the high implied volatility Just like they're doing on the screen. They're hitting the grid going up to the The funnel there in the in the middle of the page Changing it you know to high implied volatility and coming up with a bunch of stocks and a bunch of stock really only only comes out to be about Five or six by the time you've done it don't have earnings and you're setting all your parameters that you want So you said to me how about we go to volatility. Let's take a look at volatility you can take that screen down and I said I thought to myself okay It's probably one of the hardest things to understand But if you can understand it from the very beginning from a really high level a conceptual level Then it just becomes any other product just like everything else. Tom always has this saying like you know, do you want like the practical Application of something and learn how to trade it or do you want to have a sausage is made? Redden rather know how it's made and just okay now Okay, so I'm a little bit of the I'm a little bit different like I if somebody told me and I believe what they were saying that this is the way to do something I don't really care like like so what is volatility? What's it made up of? I don't think you really care. Do you do not I'm trying to say like like um you came up to me and said let's trade Vxx vxx. Okay. What is Vxx? It's very hard to understand is definitely okay, so you're one you want we get to trade yeah and you want to trade something You don't understand because you're anxious and you like what you see and we've we've discussed volatility and how it's been low currently and you know Just as in an intuition, you know, I thought okay well if it's hard to find stocks that are in our Criteria, why don't we go for volatility which we identify that is low? You're your spot on what you're thinking and I 100% agree with you and I think it's what we should do otherwise It would be having this discussion with you today But the first thing I said to you before you made your first trade was what do you need if you're gonna be a successful trader? Do you remember? The one thing I think that confidence confidence How can you have confidence in something that you don't know what it is like you don't understand what it is Does it does it make sense? Yeah, all right, so I'm gonna put up let's put up one slide for you and we'll go through the products The volatility products that I think you should learn about and how to trade so the first one that we're gonna come up here With and it'll pop up there is Vxx Now Vxx it says this and these are just my little Shorten version of of what everything is not like how the sausage is made but in practical application Vxx with a stock that you want to trade I put up their first. It's exposure to the S&P 500 VIX short-term futures I don't think you know what the VIX short-term futures are right no, okay great that's good You're not supposed to you get brand new at the next one is UVxy That's an ultra fund ultra just means that it's a multiple typically two or three times the movement So it's kind of like two or three times the movement two times in this exam example UVxy of Vxx those short-term futures index again The third product that we trade is the VIX itself and that's VIX the symbols to each one is Vxx UVxy and VIX there are other products, but these are the three most liquid. These are three that I trade all the time Okay, the VIX is quoted in percentages and translates roughly to the expected move of the S&P 500 now of all of them Maybe I'm this speaking for a moment. Well you tell me of all of them. Which one has Which one seems more familiar to you? I mean the VIX would be the most familiar because I'm familiar with the S&P 500 so I would imagine that's From what I read about the X-AX it was You know VIX was the S&P 500 and then VXS Vxx was You know some kind of measure of that volatility. Okay, so I okay Again, how the sausage is made doesn't really matter to me But if we can understand the VIX VIX we probably can get to Vxx and then probably UVxy Anytime you see something that's like a two or three time multiple think about it How do they create a product that can move two or three times something? I mean, it's not it's not voodoo economics. They have to use something that has a lot more risk So as you get more of a multiplier the more risk you have that doesn't mean that's a bad thing It just means you have to understand the risk so you can have the confidence to make the trade So the first one that we should go into is VIX if we were gonna look to make a trade now now VIX is a real funny all Volatility is kind of a real funny product. I'm gonna save you making the trade until tomorrow because Vxx and you can take that down for a moment Vxx is quoted off of forward slash Vx Now I think you're gonna have to put up the toss platform because the Doe platform doesn't support You can just go in forward slash VX is fine So that VIX product we're gonna get to in a moment is Price off of this product Now I want to go into this tomorrow and not today because if you notice it re-what it says up there CBOE Volatility index VIX the futures and what does it say July? July okay July futures are expiring Mean they're done after today. Yeah, so what we're gonna look at on Tomorrow on the VX futures is going to be August now if you put in forward slash VX Q5 Tomorrow this will be What VIX is priced off of it's what it's priced off of today also? We'll get to the moment's what it's priced off of today, but you know, it's the prices around 14 and a half 14 dollars and 43 cents All right, let's go let's go to Doe for a moment and remember that price of 14 and a half and put in VIX for a moment Sure they could make this trade today. I just think it's it's a Easier conversation for you if we make it tomorrow and and so you can explain it go to the table perfect and stay in August Okay, um On the dough platform just like the toss platform and Again, this is why volatility products are so I mean you just learned about calls and puts and iron condors and Strangles and now you're getting into a product that's Where's VIX trading at? um $12.70 cents right so so Where would on the if you were looking at this was any other stock where would you be looking for like what's the first strike in the money? 12.5 right the 12 and a half strike Perfect answer, but remember what I told you a moment ago think about where those VIX futures are trading at the 14 14 and a half The first strike in the money here is really 14 and a half Because it's in August if you can put a a triangular or rectangle around the August month Because these are August The IX options priced off of the August futures, okay Does that make sense not at all? Okay get out of August So and go to July okay stop for a moment Remember we were talking about the July futures a moment ago, which are trading right around $12.80 The computer's correct that showing you the 12 and a half call as the first strike in the money Since the computer is looking at the July Pass it has one day left so exactly exactly so tomorrow This will be a lot cleaner. I want to have this discussion with you today so you can see this this difference between when the When the futures expire so you can see which ones in the money tomorrow go back to August There'll be no more July options August will be there and this price won't be 1270 anymore. It'll be somewhere near 14 bucks Okay, okay, so the so because of the futures because the futures so can I give you a can I give you a Like I almost like a trade hack Okay, if you look at the the call and the put that's closest to the same price That's the at the money option in almost any product that you look at you notice how the puts a dollar $25 a dollar 30 the call is one 15 120 that's the at the money option If you look at the 12 and a half call think about it for a moment. How can the 12 you know everything is time and price How can something that has 28 days Have basically no premium at the 12 and a half line Do you know what I'm saying like the call is two dollars and 20 cents and the put is 20 cents doesn't make sense Does that make yeah Okay, so if you were going to to be bullish on volatility and you wanted to Buy a call spread in August today. What would you do? I Mean you have to go to the 14 and a half strike price you couldn't do it at the 12 and a half now So we like to buy one strike or two strikes with three strikes in the money and sell one strike two strikes with three strikes out of the money So if I was looking to buy and at the money call spread here with a 50 50 shot I might look at something like you know the 13 16 call spread or the 14 15 call spread depending on how much risk I want to put on does that make sense yeah, okay, so so let's Let's review what we will have about a minute and a half left. Let's review what we what we spoke about a little bit here What we talked all about was volatility products We talked about three and really from a high level Vxx UVxy and Vxx I want you to watch this show over again because this is really a it's a it's not a difficult subject, but it has some It has some differences compared to other equity products That's why you have to understand it so you can have the confidence to make the trade Before you actually make the trade I'm going to give you one little trade hack And this is something we talk about all the time a 19% implied volatility equals a 1% Daily move So if volatility right now is about 15% That's what in August futures are saying And The e-mini s and p's are 2100 if they move 20 points they're moving more Then they're implied volatility so a normal move should be somewhere around that 12 or 13 Point move which we're having today. Yeah, today so today so today at its implied volatility It's a normal move. Yes, it's been in one direction because it'd be 13 up or 13 down But it's about what the implied volatility says if we move 20 then we're moving outside of that implied volatility 19% implied volatility equals a 1% daily move now you have some sort of Concept on on reasonable expectations for how much a product should move All right cool. All right good job, but you tomorrow you make it trade your first trade in VIX Who comes up next tonight? What do I normally say peace peace?

Transcript:  I Mickey, where do I start that versus bat? You know, I didn't realize something every time we start this show There's this like big hands of picture of just you. I know How'd you work that out? Well, we got some pictures together coming soon. I think okay. All right good Well, gotta shoot a spotlight with me a little bit, right? Yeah. All right, so As we do every day After my show is over at 11 o'clock We do a show in the morning from 7 to 11 Tom Sazofa myself We have a little lunch and then you kind of come buzzing around and What do you always ask me? I give you the kind of the nudges like hey, hey, come on. What's plan? What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do and what I get I have the itch now So I got it you've been bit. Yeah, and since you're on for the first five hours I got to sit up and look at my portfolio page the whole time I can't put anything on I got weight I got weight so okay, I can understand that so let me backtrack for a moment Do you know how long it took me to make my first trade? Three years Why was that for three years? I worked at a job just like you're doing and Then saved enough money to open up a trading account saved enough money To buy a seat on the floor of the exchange Which actually somebody lent me the money to and up until that moment all I could do was paper trade like fake trade So you've been at this this is gonna be this is the first full week, right? I mean of actual trades. I think we made a first day on Monday we did last week Friday Friday the week prior but Friday the week last last last week was our first trading for a week Yeah, sometimes you just got to pump the brakes a little bit and Understand some of the products. So what you did to me today was you came up to me said You know what there's not a lot to trade you have a lot more technology than I ever had like I was Subjected just a few stocks that I that I was able to trade on the floor of the CBOE you have access to everything And I know you go through the dough platform and you you go to the high and volatility You want to do that for me if you if you don't mind Nikki you don't have to do it with the other screen for a moment and you go through the high implied volatility Just like they're doing on the screen. They're hitting the grid going up to the The funnel there in the in the middle of the page Changing it you know to high implied volatility and coming up with a bunch of stocks and a bunch of stock really only only comes out to be about Five or six by the time you've done it don't have earnings and you're setting all your parameters that you want So you said to me how about we go to volatility. Let's take a look at volatility you can take that screen down and I said I thought to myself okay It's probably one of the hardest things to understand But if you can understand it from the very beginning from a really high level a conceptual level Then it just becomes any other product just like everything else. Tom always has this saying like you know, do you want like the practical Application of something and learn how to trade it or do you want to have a sausage is made? Redden rather know how it's made and just okay now Okay, so I'm a little bit of the I'm a little bit different like I if somebody told me and I believe what they were saying that this is the way to do something I don't really care like like so what is volatility? What's it made up of? I don't think you really care. Do you do not I'm trying to say like like um you came up to me and said let's trade Vxx vxx. Okay. What is Vxx? It's very hard to understand is definitely okay, so you're one you want we get to trade yeah and you want to trade something You don't understand because you're anxious and you like what you see and we've we've discussed volatility and how it's been low currently and you know Just as in an intuition, you know, I thought okay well if it's hard to find stocks that are in our Criteria, why don't we go for volatility which we identify that is low? You're your spot on what you're thinking and I 100% agree with you and I think it's what we should do otherwise It would be having this discussion with you today But the first thing I said to you before you made your first trade was what do you need if you're gonna be a successful trader? Do you remember? The one thing I think that confidence confidence How can you have confidence in something that you don't know what it is like you don't understand what it is Does it does it make sense? Yeah, all right, so I'm gonna put up let's put up one slide for you and we'll go through the products The volatility products that I think you should learn about and how to trade so the first one that we're gonna come up here With and it'll pop up there is Vxx Now Vxx it says this and these are just my little Shorten version of of what everything is not like how the sausage is made but in practical application Vxx with a stock that you want to trade I put up their first. It's exposure to the S&P 500 VIX short-term futures I don't think you know what the VIX short-term futures are right no, okay great that's good You're not supposed to you get brand new at the next one is UVxy That's an ultra fund ultra just means that it's a multiple typically two or three times the movement So it's kind of like two or three times the movement two times in this exam example UVxy of Vxx those short-term futures index again The third product that we trade is the VIX itself and that's VIX the symbols to each one is Vxx UVxy and VIX there are other products, but these are the three most liquid. These are three that I trade all the time Okay, the VIX is quoted in percentages and translates roughly to the expected move of the S&P 500 now of all of them Maybe I'm this speaking for a moment. Well you tell me of all of them. Which one has Which one seems more familiar to you? I mean the VIX would be the most familiar because I'm familiar with the S&P 500 so I would imagine that's From what I read about the X-AX it was You know VIX was the S&P 500 and then VXS Vxx was You know some kind of measure of that volatility. Okay, so I okay Again, how the sausage is made doesn't really matter to me But if we can understand the VIX VIX we probably can get to Vxx and then probably UVxy Anytime you see something that's like a two or three time multiple think about it How do they create a product that can move two or three times something? I mean, it's not it's not voodoo economics. They have to use something that has a lot more risk So as you get more of a multiplier the more risk you have that doesn't mean that's a bad thing It just means you have to understand the risk so you can have the confidence to make the trade So the first one that we should go into is VIX if we were gonna look to make a trade now now VIX is a real funny all Volatility is kind of a real funny product. I'm gonna save you making the trade until tomorrow because Vxx and you can take that down for a moment Vxx is quoted off of forward slash Vx Now I think you're gonna have to put up the toss platform because the Doe platform doesn't support You can just go in forward slash VX is fine So that VIX product we're gonna get to in a moment is Price off of this product Now I want to go into this tomorrow and not today because if you notice it re-what it says up there CBOE Volatility index VIX the futures and what does it say July? July okay July futures are expiring Mean they're done after today. Yeah, so what we're gonna look at on Tomorrow on the VX futures is going to be August now if you put in forward slash VX Q5 Tomorrow this will be What VIX is priced off of it's what it's priced off of today also? We'll get to the moment's what it's priced off of today, but you know, it's the prices around 14 and a half 14 dollars and 43 cents All right, let's go let's go to Doe for a moment and remember that price of 14 and a half and put in VIX for a moment Sure they could make this trade today. I just think it's it's a Easier conversation for you if we make it tomorrow and and so you can explain it go to the table perfect and stay in August Okay, um On the dough platform just like the toss platform and Again, this is why volatility products are so I mean you just learned about calls and puts and iron condors and Strangles and now you're getting into a product that's Where's VIX trading at? um $12.70 cents right so so Where would on the if you were looking at this was any other stock where would you be looking for like what's the first strike in the money? 12.5 right the 12 and a half strike Perfect answer, but remember what I told you a moment ago think about where those VIX futures are trading at the 14 14 and a half The first strike in the money here is really 14 and a half Because it's in August if you can put a a triangular or rectangle around the August month Because these are August The IX options priced off of the August futures, okay Does that make sense not at all? Okay get out of August So and go to July okay stop for a moment Remember we were talking about the July futures a moment ago, which are trading right around $12.80 The computer's correct that showing you the 12 and a half call as the first strike in the money Since the computer is looking at the July Pass it has one day left so exactly exactly so tomorrow This will be a lot cleaner. I want to have this discussion with you today so you can see this this difference between when the When the futures expire so you can see which ones in the money tomorrow go back to August There'll be no more July options August will be there and this price won't be 1270 anymore. It'll be somewhere near 14 bucks Okay, okay, so the so because of the futures because the futures so can I give you a can I give you a Like I almost like a trade hack Okay, if you look at the the call and the put that's closest to the same price That's the at the money option in almost any product that you look at you notice how the puts a dollar $25 a dollar 30 the call is one 15 120 that's the at the money option If you look at the 12 and a half call think about it for a moment. How can the 12 you know everything is time and price How can something that has 28 days Have basically no premium at the 12 and a half line Do you know what I'm saying like the call is two dollars and 20 cents and the put is 20 cents doesn't make sense Does that make yeah Okay, so if you were going to to be bullish on volatility and you wanted to Buy a call spread in August today. What would you do? I Mean you have to go to the 14 and a half strike price you couldn't do it at the 12 and a half now So we like to buy one strike or two strikes with three strikes in the money and sell one strike two strikes with three strikes out of the money So if I was looking to buy and at the money call spread here with a 50 50 shot I might look at something like you know the 13 16 call spread or the 14 15 call spread depending on how much risk I want to put on does that make sense yeah, okay, so so let's Let's review what we will have about a minute and a half left.

Transcript:  Thank you. Nicky, where do I start? That versus bat. How are you son? Doing well. I'm doing well. We'll get to my trade, but I've got a little bone to pick with you today. Oh, okay. Go ahead. You know, earlier today, they were talking about Mike's new show, Mike and his white board. That's correct. I was telling you this early this morning. I had a Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Okay. 15 to 330. Okay. But Tom made a Slile over mark. He was like, you know, maybe we'll slide it in there and take the bat versus bat time slot and you're pretty quiet there. You're nothing, nothing. I sat there like a subordinate. Yeah, you don't consider that going against the family or what it is. Sometimes you got to keep your friends close and your enemies closer. So we just let Tom talk and everything. Something is all going to be ours, son. Don't worry about it. There's a revolution going on out there and he doesn't see it. Okay. All right. So listen, you wanted to make a new trade today. I want to review a trade that you put on yesterday and took off today. Let's try to do both and let's try to do them in a quick fashion. Okay. All right. Let's go. Let's just use the other platform and let's put up, let's put up dough for a moment. Let's use that screen for a second. All right. Let's go to tiles like we always go. The grid. You mentioned to me, we've already set up the same way. We found FCX. All we did was we went to the, like we do every day. I find this is that every day I look to find a trade. The first place I go, the first place I go is right here. And then I click on the funnel and I change it to the, to what I want. We're going to stay in the front month in August. So I have 24 days to, to exclude all the earnings. Have the earnings excluded. That would be the little arrow, the little blue circle up on top there. That's, yeah, perfect. And then I go from IV rank of 50 to 100. Okay. Spits out a list for me. You liked, you picked not me, which stuck? I was looking at Monsand. It was actually down, I mean, like it's been up and down all day today, but it was down like seven cents from the open price. You know, when I was looking at it, it moved up a little bit. But you know, it's one of those that are on an opt tickets relatively low in terms of, it's position in the, you know, over on the last 52 weeks, it's close to all time low. In the last 30 days, it's kind of gone from, you know, 105 to 110 down to, to 100. 105 to 110. Go to 105, the 110 to 100. You know, it's kind of been back and forth. So it's like right in the middle of that range now. And so I figured we would make a plan it. Okay. I didn't understand everything that you said there. For the reasons why I did it, I wish you would have said, high IV rank 80%. Well, that's always, that's what we're looking for. That's what we're filtering out is high IV ranks, no earnings. But all that other crap you spewed means nothing. I mean, it really means nothing because, because you have no idea where it's going to go. Any more than I have any idea where it's going to go, but you got a high implied IV rank 80%. What strategies can you use? I want to know. This is, hold on, this is important. Not, went down to, you said it's seven cents. It's actually been below $100 today. It's had a $1.5 move or something like that today. So all that other stuff, all color. That's old. No, no, I mean, I'm trying to be honest. I'm trying to be funny, but those are the things that I'm looking at it in deciding on why I want to pick this. I know, of course, IVR, all those things. I only have 30 years of doing this. Here, you do it. You show, you show us. What do you, shouldn't you have at least some kind of opinion? No, I'll give you your opinion. No, I don't mean your opinion. Mechanics? Yes. I agree. I mean, what about other stuff that you did? That's just bullshit. No, no, I'm being serious with you. Like, that's just like saying, you know, China's down 4% last night. What do you think the market was going to do today? I would have probably said lower. I think 90% of the people are the majority of the people who have said probably, market was going last time China was down 4% we went lower. Why would we go? It's all bull crap. What you have to do is find the right strategy to fit what's going on with the stock that you want to trade. You have Monsanto. It's down. Let's take a look. It's down about seven. Let's go to a chart on toss for a quick second. So it's down about 6%. I was going to say 7%. It's down 6% over the last 10 days. It definitely has a high implied volatility rank of 80%. What kind of strategy can you use in the stock? That's the mechanics. So what are you going to do? I want to sell and I want to sell. You want to sell premium. Yeah. So when you say sell, that means you want to get bearish on the stock. You want to sell some sort of premium on the stock. Yeah. Okay. I was thinking a strangle on it to sell both the put and the call. Perfect. Okay. So you want to go to the curve view of the table view. It doesn't matter to me. I usually like to start at the curve view. All right. Let's go to the curve. We're going to stay in August. Okay. A classic strangle. What delta are you looking to sell? I don't know. On each side. I believe I told you this with the maybe I didn't. I don't think so. I probably didn't. Okay. I mean, so I'll give it to you. A classic strangle that we want to sell typically one standard deviation. So go back to the strategies for a minute. And you got to get a September where you can change the settings in a minute. Go to strangle, open up the advanced settings. Use that expiration to 24. You can just click on one standard deviation if you want and click on go. Okay. So it brings up the 95 put and the 109 call that's with 24 days to go in August. Just as a guide, we want to collect at least the dollar. How much are we collecting here? 104. 104 is the mid price. It looks like it's about a 4 cent wide market. One dollar bit is the natural bid. 108 is the natural offer. Mid price of 104 typically gets filled around 50% of time. So you might have to move it a penny up or down depending on whether you're buying or selling it. We like to collect the dollar and we like to collect the dollar when there's at least 45 days to expiration. Now there's 24 days to expiration. So the one standard deviation, those two white lines are going to be a little tighter than if it was 54 days to go. If you look at September, September standard deviation is going to be wider out. Does that make sense? There's more days. There's more time. There's more time to it. So this is a perfect fit for the strategy that you want to do. Now this is not skewed in any way. The stock is basically in the middle. The stock is 101. The put is 95. So how many strikes away? Six strikes away. And then it's eight to the... I guess seven. Seven. You round it to 102 because it's the 67. Seven and change. So you can say you have a little bit more room to the upside than you do on the downside. Does that make sense? Yeah. That's a classic strangle, a classic price that we like to get. You're going to use about $1300 in buying power going out that wide in this stock. Okay. I'm coming back. So I love it. I think that's a good play. All the other stuff means nothing. If you wanted to say, hey, high implied volatility, IV rank, and I want to be bullish. So I want to move the put side up further. I say perfect. You say high IV rank, and I want to be bearish on the stock. I would say, well, you know what, stocks had a six, seven percent move down. We typically like to play a little bit of a contrarian role. I would kind of shy away from that trade. Let's go a little bit more neutral just so that I can instill my will on you and my thinking so that we can move on with the learning process. But I like what you did there. But I don't like the way you sold it to me. You know what I'm saying? It's so easy. All that other stuff is just background noise. Makes sense? Yeah. Okay. Move the strikes out one. Just go wider. See what happens. You can click the thing too on top. Okay. Perfect. If I said we were going to do this strangle, what would you tell me? Has a higher probability of success than the last one? Yeah. I mean, it just, the premium that we're getting is not perfect with the risk. Stop right there. Stop right there. Your father, mentor, the guy who wipes your butt and change your diapers, who wipes your nose when you were three and is now looking to show you how to trade says a dollar is what I need to collect. Yeah. So that doesn't fit. Move it in two strikes. What's wrong with this trade? Can't get filled on the call. But why can't you get filled on the call? Let's get in it, it's illiquid. You've got the little, oh there we go. It came back. That's okay. That doesn't mean you can't be filled. That just means the market's a little bit wife what we like. So you'd have to take a second look at it, which is a great catch. I didn't see it. But what would be wrong with this one? If anything. If anything. I mean, it's slightly inside the standard deviation. So I mean, we like to be outside the one standard deviation. So. But you could do it. I'm saying like it doesn't, it still fits. You could go closer, closer, closer. It all still fits. It wouldn't have as high probability of success, but it all fits. All right. Let's widen the strikes back out to the standard deviation that we had a moment ago. 95, 109. Let's just put this in at 104. And if we have to move it, you'll go down a penny or two. Cool. All right. I want to, since we did that, I know you want to put on the trade. I want to talk about something that you did that doesn't happen in the short time frame that you were able to do yesterday in FCX. Yeah. So let's take a quick second to review what we did yesterday on a covered call. A covered call is just like any other type of strategy that we put on. We like to, we seem to have our profits, our 50% target at around 20 days. It's like a magic number, like 20, 23, 18, 27. Somewhere inside that 20-day timeframe on average, we have a chance to collect a 50% of our max profit. I should have wrote max profit in there. Okay. That max profit, there's only one way to figure it out. In FCX, you paid 1061 for the covered call, meaning you bought stock and you sold 11.5 call. I did the math up here for you. Where do I get the 11.5 from and where do I get the 1061 from? Well, the 11.5 was the call. So that's where we would be selling our shares at that price. So the amount that we received in premium minus the price of the stock when we bought it was or minus the call strike is where our max profit is. You can't make any more money over 11.50s, what you're trying to say. Yes. Right? So that's our max profit. We paid 1061. So we have risk from 1061 because we can't lose anything more than what we paid for it. So 1061 is our max, what we paid for it, that's how much we can lose. And we can only make up to 11.50. So we can only make that difference, which is 89 cents or 89 bucks. Today, FCX had a nice move up of around $1.20. You had a profit in there of not your target of 45 cents, but you had a profit in there of around 44%. You told me you did the math. Yeah, I was like 44%. 44% of the max profit is. 44% at 39 bucks. Right. It's not like it's not the dollar amount because it's a small dollar amount, $39. You only had $250 in margin being used. Yes. Right? I mean, it was like $230 or something like that of $240. So you had a small amount of money. Over night, you make 44% of your possible profit. You run like a thief in the night. Yeah, I mean, you can't add that much. I mean, it doesn't have there. A covered call is typically a slow moving strategy. You want the stock to slowly move up or fast move up, but stocks don't usually go up a $120, $10 or $11 stock. Over night. Doesn't go up 10% typically overnight. Yeah. You take the profit you run and you never look back. You don't break up the order. You don't try to make it into something else like buy back your call and sell a call higher or buy back your call and sell another call in a month. No, it's a gift. You take it and you run. All right. All right. Good job, Adiou. Good job. Listen, you've been doing this what? It'll be going on two weeks now. No more than that. I think three weeks, I think. Time flies when you have them from your son. Good job, Adiou. All right. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. What I normally say. All right.

Transcript:  Thank you. Nicky, where do I start? That versus bat. How are you son? Doing well. I'm doing well. We'll get to my trade, but I've got a little bone to pick with you today. Oh, okay. Go ahead. You know, earlier today, they were talking about Mike's new show, Mike and his white board. That's correct. I was telling you this early this morning. I had a Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Okay. 15 to 330. Okay. But Tom made a Slile over mark. He was like, you know, maybe we'll slide it in there and take the bat versus bat time slot and you're pretty quiet there. You're nothing, nothing. I sat there like a subordinate. Yeah, you don't consider that going against the family or what it is. Sometimes you got to keep your friends close and your enemies closer. So we just let Tom talk and everything. Something is all going to be ours, son. Don't worry about it. There's a revolution going on out there and he doesn't see it. Okay. All right. So listen, you wanted to make a new trade today. I want to review a trade that you put on yesterday and took off today. Let's try to do both and let's try to do them in a quick fashion. Okay. All right. Let's go. Let's just use the other platform and let's put up, let's put up dough for a moment. Let's use that screen for a second. All right. Let's go to tiles like we always go. The grid. You mentioned to me, we've already set up the same way. We found FCX. All we did was we went to the, like we do every day. I find this is that every day I look to find a trade. The first place I go, the first place I go is right here. And then I click on the funnel and I change it to the, to what I want. We're going to stay in the front month in August. So I have 24 days to, to exclude all the earnings. Have the earnings excluded. That would be the little arrow, the little blue circle up on top there. That's, yeah, perfect. And then I go from IV rank of 50 to 100. Okay. Spits out a list for me. You liked, you picked not me, which stuck? I was looking at Monsand. It was actually down, I mean, like it's been up and down all day today, but it was down like seven cents from the open price. You know, when I was looking at it, it moved up a little bit. But you know, it's one of those that are on an opt tickets relatively low in terms of, it's position in the, you know, over on the last 52 weeks, it's close to all time low. In the last 30 days, it's kind of gone from, you know, 105 to 110 down to, to 100. 105 to 110. Go to 105, the 110 to 100. You know, it's kind of been back and forth. So it's like right in the middle of that range now. And so I figured we would make a plan it. Okay. I didn't understand everything that you said there. For the reasons why I did it, I wish you would have said, high IV rank 80%. Well, that's always, that's what we're looking for. That's what we're filtering out is high IV ranks, no earnings. But all that other crap you spewed means nothing. I mean, it really means nothing because, because you have no idea where it's going to go. Any more than I have any idea where it's going to go, but you got a high implied IV rank 80%. What strategies can you use? I want to know. This is, hold on, this is important. Not, went down to, you said it's seven cents. It's actually been below $100 today. It's had a $1.5 move or something like that today. So all that other stuff, all color. That's old. No, no, I mean, I'm trying to be honest. I'm trying to be funny, but those are the things that I'm looking at it in deciding on why I want to pick this. I know, of course, IVR, all those things. I only have 30 years of doing this. Here, you do it. You show, you show us. What do you, shouldn't you have at least some kind of opinion? No, I'll give you your opinion. No, I don't mean your opinion. Mechanics? Yes. I agree. I mean, what about other stuff that you did? That's just bullshit. No, no, I'm being serious with you. Like, that's just like saying, you know, China's down 4% last night. What do you think the market was going to do today? I would have probably said lower. I think 90% of the people are the majority of the people who have said probably, market was going last time China was down 4% we went lower. Why would we go? It's all bull crap. What you have to do is find the right strategy to fit what's going on with the stock that you want to trade. You have Monsanto. It's down. Let's take a look. It's down about seven. Let's go to a chart on toss for a quick second. So it's down about 6%. I was going to say 7%. It's down 6% over the last 10 days. It definitely has a high implied volatility rank of 80%. What kind of strategy can you use in the stock? That's the mechanics. So what are you going to do? I want to sell and I want to sell. You want to sell premium. Yeah. So when you say sell, that means you want to get bearish on the stock. You want to sell some sort of premium on the stock. Yeah. Okay. I was thinking a strangle on it to sell both the put and the call. Perfect. Okay. So you want to go to the curve view of the table view. It doesn't matter to me. I usually like to start at the curve view. All right. Let's go to the curve. We're going to stay in August. Okay. A classic strangle. What delta are you looking to sell? I don't know. On each side. I believe I told you this with the maybe I didn't. I don't think so. I probably didn't. Okay. I mean, so I'll give it to you. A classic strangle that we want to sell typically one standard deviation. So go back to the strategies for a minute. And you got to get a September where you can change the settings in a minute. Go to strangle, open up the advanced settings. Use that expiration to 24. You can just click on one standard deviation if you want and click on go. Okay. So it brings up the 95 put and the 109 call that's with 24 days to go in August. Just as a guide, we want to collect at least the dollar. How much are we collecting here? 104. 104 is the mid price. It looks like it's about a 4 cent wide market. One dollar bit is the natural bid. 108 is the natural offer. Mid price of 104 typically gets filled around 50% of time. So you might have to move it a penny up or down depending on whether you're buying or selling it. We like to collect the dollar and we like to collect the dollar when there's at least 45 days to expiration. Now there's 24 days to expiration. So the one standard deviation, those two white lines are going to be a little tighter than if it was 54 days to go. If you look at September, September standard deviation is going to be wider out. Does that make sense? There's more days. There's more time. There's more time to it. So this is a perfect fit for the strategy that you want to do. Now this is not skewed in any way. The stock is basically in the middle. The stock is 101. The put is 95. So how many strikes away? Six strikes away. And then it's eight to the... I guess seven. Seven. You round it to 102 because it's the 67. Seven and change. So you can say you have a little bit more room to the upside than you do on the downside. Does that make sense? Yeah. That's a classic strangle, a classic price that we like to get. You're going to use about $1300 in buying power going out that wide in this stock. Okay. I'm coming back. So I love it. I think that's a good play. All the other stuff means nothing. If you wanted to say, hey, high implied volatility, IV rank, and I want to be bullish. So I want to move the put side up further. I say perfect. You say high IV rank, and I want to be bearish on the stock. I would say, well, you know what, stocks had a six, seven percent move down. We typically like to play a little bit of a contrarian role. I would kind of shy away from that trade. Let's go a little bit more neutral just so that I can instill my will on you and my thinking so that we can move on with the learning process. But I like what you did there. But I don't like the way you sold it to me. You know what I'm saying? It's so easy. All that other stuff is just background noise. Makes sense? Yeah. Okay. Move the strikes out one. Just go wider. See what happens. You can click the thing too on top. Okay. Perfect. If I said we were going to do this strangle, what would you tell me? Has a higher probability of success than the last one? Yeah. I mean, it just, the premium that we're getting is not perfect with the risk. Stop right there. Stop right there. Your father, mentor, the guy who wipes your butt and change your diapers, who wipes your nose when you were three and is now looking to show you how to trade says a dollar is what I need to collect. Yeah. So that doesn't fit. Move it in two strikes. What's wrong with this trade? Can't get filled on the call. But why can't you get filled on the call? Let's get in it, it's illiquid. You've got the little, oh there we go. It came back. That's okay. That doesn't mean you can't be filled. That just means the market's a little bit wife what we like. So you'd have to take a second look at it, which is a great catch. I didn't see it. But what would be wrong with this one? If anything. If anything. I mean, it's slightly inside the standard deviation. So I mean, we like to be outside the one standard deviation. So. But you could do it. I'm saying like it doesn't, it still fits. You could go closer, closer, closer. It all still fits. It wouldn't have as high probability of success, but it all fits. All right. Let's widen the strikes back out to the standard deviation that we had a moment ago. 95, 109. Let's just put this in at 104. And if we have to move it, you'll go down a penny or two. Cool. All right. I want to, since we did that, I know you want to put on the trade. I want to talk about something that you did that doesn't happen in the short time frame that you were able to do yesterday in FCX. Yeah. So let's take a quick second to review what we did yesterday on a covered call. A covered call is just like any other type of strategy that we put on. We like to, we seem to have our profits, our 50% target at around 20 days. It's like a magic number, like 20, 23, 18, 27. Somewhere inside that 20-day timeframe on average, we have a chance to collect a 50% of our max profit. I should have wrote max profit in there. Okay. That max profit, there's only one way to figure it out. In FCX, you paid 1061 for the covered call, meaning you bought stock and you sold 11.5 call. I did the math up here for you. Where do I get the 11.5 from and where do I get the 1061 from? Well, the 11.5 was the call. So that's where we would be selling our shares at that price. So the amount that we received in premium minus the price of the stock when we bought it was or minus the call strike is where our max profit is. You can't make any more money over 11.50s, what you're trying to say. Yes. Right? So that's our max profit. We paid 1061. So we have risk from 1061 because we can't lose anything more than what we paid for it. So 1061 is our max, what we paid for it, that's how much we can lose. And we can only make up to 11.50. So we can only make that difference, which is 89 cents or 89 bucks. Today, FCX had a nice move up of around $1.20. You had a profit in there of not your target of 45 cents, but you had a profit in there of around 44%. You told me you did the math. Yeah, I was like 44%. 44% of the max profit is. 44% at 39 bucks. Right. It's not like it's not the dollar amount because it's a small dollar amount, $39. You only had $250 in margin being used. Yes. Right? I mean, it was like $230 or something like that of $240. So you had a small amount of money. Over night, you make 44% of your possible profit. You run like a thief in the night. Yeah, I mean, you can't add that much. I mean, it doesn't have there. A covered call is typically a slow moving strategy. You want the stock to slowly move up or fast move up, but stocks don't usually go up a $120, $10 or $11 stock. Over night. Doesn't go up 10% typically overnight. Yeah. You take the profit you run and you never look back. You don't break up the order. You don't try to make it into something else like buy back your call and sell a call higher or buy back your call and sell another call in a month. No, it's a gift. You take it and you run. All right. All right. Good job, Adiou. Good job. Listen, you've been doing this what? It'll be going on two weeks now. No more than that. I think three weeks, I think. Time flies when you have them from your son. Good job, Adiou. All right. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. What I normally say. Yes. We've done it so-that I can't help this.

Transcript:  I'm going to be a good guy. I'm going to be a good guy. Mickey, where do I start? That versus bat. How are you? Doing well. How was my son today? Son is good today. Good. Well, I'm Tony Batista. This is my son. We're learning how to trade or go into the process. Hopefully everybody will come along with the journey. I also have a name at SNCC. It's not. It's June. Well, my mother is bad. Junior. You're not a junior? No. No. I get those on the live chat. I have one guy. That's his name. Abe. Abe. He gave me three choices. He said, oh, he's going to name me? Yeah, he said, okay, here are your three choices for what I'm going to call you every time we chat. He's a frequent chatter. So it was bad, junior. It was mini-bat, and then it was bat-in-ho, which is a, like, a Native American term for small. So like, bat-small. Okay. I kind of like that one too. I like that one too. Do you know what your name was going to be if it was up to your mother? Tyler. Yeah. You want to buy me a coffee someday? Well, we'll take the Saints name. But that's a good one. Thank you for that one. Yes, Tyler. She wanted to call you Ty. Ty. Oh, that's just precious. Not to rob it today. I just didn't, I know. I couldn't have it. Anyway. How's your day today? Oh, it was good. I mean, it was good. Okay. Yeah. Okay. You've been looking at the market a little bit today. What's the market doing today? E-minis are up about 15 NASDAQ. Up another 20. So you've been watching getting kind of engaged. Two weeks ago, when we first started this, three weeks ago, when we first started this, did you ever look at the market before or anything like that? Not really. Not really. And you were in the finance field, right? Yeah. Yeah. And a finger of the finance field, right? Mm-hmm. It's amazing, right? Like how things can change so much, like something that's been around for basically forever, you know, you don't really like look at it and watch it. And now it consumes, you know, your day while you're doing your other job. Mm-hmm. Two. But you do a good job on supporting everything. All right. So let's take a look at your account today, okay? So the first thing I want to take a look at is, let's just go to Do. And before we find the trade, and we have an idea of a trade that we want to go to, first thing I want to do is always just look at your overall account. Again, we're just going to that, like that green area there, also up on the top left there where it says that 66% that's your overall portfolio's probability of profit. Like that to be over 50%. Ideally wrapped around 68%. Because that's basically standard deviation. Um, like to have in a perfect world, is a perfect world. This is not like what happens. Like if it may affect, if you looked at your account two days ago, your green area was more, more bullish because the market had been going a little bit lower. Now it's more in the middle of, uh, the middle of the range. Okay. So I like everything that's happening with your account, probably of profit, everything else like that. You only have, you know, four, three or four or five trades, um, in your account. So we want to put on another trade in your account. What's the first thing that you would do and what I like to do every time I'm looking to make a trade? You're under the grid. Okay. And then, uh, like to, uh, filter out earnings and, um, set our IV range, IVR range to be 50 to 100. So we'll, uh, we'll do, uh, yeah, 50 to 100 there. And then the earnings range will be, uh, 23 days. So we don't want earnings within 23 days right now or 45 is our, um, this is what I want to talk about a little bit today. So 45 is our, is our wheelhouse. Now, with 23 days left to expiration, which you are correct in August of 23 days, we're kind of, we're kind of in like no man's land in my eyes, because you have 51 days to September. I don't like to trade the weeklies on a longer term basis, longer term basis for us is 45 days. So I prefer if I could, especially as a new trader, like I'm trying to think about like you and everybody else will be listening to this as a new trader, I would rather default to closer to 45, which would bring us to 51 days. All things being equal. Okay. Does that make sense? So let's change that from 45 days to 51 days, which gets us to expiration. Because if we set it to 45 days, and a stock has earnings 47 or 48 or 49 days, inside that September expiration, it would be filtering it out and kind of give us a false reading. So if I go to expiration with 51 days, it's going to have no earnings inside that 51 days. Okay. I don't think it's going to change anything here, but I think it's just good mechanics. Yeah. And I actually had a chat today about the same idea, and one of the other things that I came up with, well, that I thought about was also the liquidity at, you know, wouldn't you prefer to go to the more, if you're in the middle of that range, where you have two expressions that are one outside the 45 range, one inside the range. Much tighter. Wouldn't you want to go to one that has more liquidity? You sure will. But let me, I'll just tell you, the front month with 20 summer days is always going to be more liquid than the back month. Just because at the back month, there are a lot of things. Just more people watching it. And also all the trades that have been made for the last 20 summer days, everybody's looking to make new ones adjust, close, open, tweak. There's always going to be a lot more liquidity and probably tighter markets in the shorter term, regular monthly options. Okay. So yeah, you want it, and it's in liquidity as king, but you kind of take a little liberty with the overall rule. Okay. Sounds good. Let's just click on that. Alright, so the top one, new month mining, 92% was actually 100 last couple of days, or close to 100. So it's actually come down a little bit, not a lot. At 92, it still is high. You'll notice that FCX was 100. It's down to 80. Now that's the last trade that you made. New month mining, FCX, both in the same type of field, gold mining, exploration, worldwide, blah, blah, blah. This stock was actually, have you watched it a little bit today? You actually sent me an IM. What did you really want to say? About 30 or 40 minutes ago, I was like, all right, I want to do any, I'm like, I want to do a cover call strategy, it's similar to what we did in FCX. And why do you want to do a cover call strategy? I mean, it's in that, obviously, the IVR is high. So, you know, selling that short call option, you know, I'm getting high premium value for that. Okay. And then it's a lower value stock price. So, I'm not, it doesn't cost me a ton to do it. I mean, it would be... Perfect. Perfect to sit, man. High implied volatility, low stock price. Perfect. That's all simple, some stuff. We're going to have to complicate it. It's perfect, did great. Okay, so, if we had an FCX trade on, which is basically in the same field, and you already have a gold iron condor trade on, then I probably wouldn't be looking at this trade. I'd be trying to look at something else. Makes sense? I just to not have all our X in the same type of... Call of correlated. Call of correlation. Don't want to have a correlated portfolio. Makes sense? All right, let's double click on an EM. I always take a little Wizard of Oz when I set an EM. I don't know why. I think it's an ATM. You know, I'm going to have to deposit a Vases. Okay. Strategy, you said, covered call. So, let's click on strategy. And let's go down to covered stock. And you can see in the advanced settings there, if we're in the right month, you can change it if you want to. So, let's make that 45 days. And as long as you have the weeklies unclicked on the right there, it's going to default to the closest monthly to 45 days, which is going to be September. So, you can always have that set at 45, and I guess we'll do the math for you. Okay, let's click go. So, we're looking to buy stock. That's the gray one... I'm sorry, the green one, that's kind of like a little bit lighter, just to show you that you're buying stock. So, the $1,1663 is probably the mid price of the offer. And then you're looking to sell the $18 call of defaults to the first call out of the money. Totally a complete and good setup. $16.55 is what you're paying for it, so what do you think your break even is? Put a circle of something around $16.55 you could. Is $16.55, that's my break even. All right, it's perfect. Not a trick question, I'm not trying to trick you anything else like that. You can also see where that red line is, and if you click, I think if you click that dollar sign, it'll also tell you how much like your buying power is, but it tells you your break even. Now, your buying power on this is not $1600. We don't have access to your back end in your account, so we default to the highest that it can be. And that would be like an IRA account. You'd be spending $654. And the highest here is the max loss. So, I mean... You're highest here is $1655. The stock could go to zero, I mean, it's been around since the 1900s. It could go to zero, but I doubt it. The brokerage firm holds about $300. No, excuse me, for a covered call about $500 to make this trade. Okay. All right, so you're risking $500. That's what I would think my max risk is to make how much? It'll be whatever I'm selling the call for, so $105. Plus... Plus... Well, you know what? Let's just do the math for you. Just click on it. All right, so your max profit on here is going to be $146. It's the difference between where the stock is right now. It was around $17.60 or something like that. The call strike, which is 18, so that's $40. Plus the 105 or 108 that you are selling the call for for a total of $143, $145, depending on how the stock is moving. So it's not just how much you're selling the call for because you're low on the stock. It's the difference between the stock and that call strike. Remember, the strike is where somebody is willing... You're getting somebody the right to buy your stock at. So you're giving them the right to buy it at 18. It's trading at $17.60, so you can make $40 there. But you're charging them some sort of premium. That premium was the $105 for the call. So you can make a total of around $145 on this covered call. I would unclick that for a quick second. And we're almost running out of time. About a 60%-59% probability of success. This is the classic thing that we did last time, classic covered call. Can I show you what Naked put for a moment? Okay, let's just unclear this and then sell the 17-put for me. Okay, so the 17-put has about a 65% probability of success. Slightly more. You're selling this for 93 cents. So what's your max profit? 93. 93 cents. What would be your break even? It'll be at whatever the strike is now minus the 93 cents. Which brings you to $16.07? Yeah. Right? Yeah, $16.70. $16.07. No, $16.70. We're at 93 cents. Stocks at 17.61. Ah, forget about the stock. You're not doing anything with stock here. You're just selling a put. A put when you sell a put, an easy way to think about it is, somebody can put stock to you. They can put stock to you at your strike price, which is 17. But you're charging them premium. You're charging them $93. So that $93 is yours. That's yours to keep, yours to have right now. So if somebody puts stock for you at 17, but you charge them $93, you break even 16.07. Okay. Now just click the button for a quick second. I mean, it does all the math for you. It's all here for you. But it's so much better. Like, I used to hate the Analyze tab on Toss, because people would use it as a crutch. If you could do the math and understand it, well, if you could do the math, then you understand it. If you look at a picture, it's a great visual, but I'm not sure you understand it. Does that make sense? Because just read off a calculator. All right. So let's go back to that trade. Which one do you want to do? Let's weigh them out. One, you make around $93 on, but you have a 65% probability of success, and a lower break even, which is good for you. The other one, you can make $145, have a higher, have a lower probability of success, and a lower break even point. Meaning, I shouldn't say lower breaking up. Your break even is closer, meaning, higher probability that you can get touched. I mean, honestly. This one uses $300. The other one uses $500. All things being equal, there's not a huge variance. You're 100% correct. Yeah, I would go, in my opinion, because I want to take a little bit more risk, I would go at the cover call, and give myself a little bit more potential. You know, potential profits. Perfect. There's no wrong answer. Because the setup, the mechanics work. So let's take a quick second here, and let's just kind of review what we went through. And the only thing that we tried to discuss here today was a difference between a covered call, and a short put, naked put. They're both bullish positions. They both want the same thing to happen. They've both very similar in break even points. One was about $0.50 higher than the other one. They both use around the same amount of money. They both use around $1,600. The caveat I would put towards this, you're in a margin account. So it's about the same trade. If you'll as in an IRA account, I'd probably do the covered call, because it uses just about the same amount as buying power as the naked put. But the covered call I can make $145, and the naked put I can only make about $94. Makes sense? Yeah. Good job, Addy. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. What do I say? Peace. Peace.

Transcript:  I'm going to be a good guy. I'm going to be a good guy. Mickey, where do I start? That versus bat. How are you? Doing well. How was my son today? Son is good today. Good. Well, I'm Tony Batista. This is my son. We're learning how to trade or go into the process. Hopefully everybody will come along with the journey. I also have a name at SNCC. It's not. It's June. Well, my mother is bad. Junior. You're not a junior? No. No. I get those on the live chat. I have one guy. That's his name. Abe. Abe. He gave me three choices. He said, oh, he's going to name me? Yeah, he said, okay, here are your three choices for what I'm going to call you every time we chat. He's a frequent chatter. So it was bad, junior. It was mini-bat, and then it was bat-in-ho, which is a, like, a Native American term for small. So like, bat-small. Okay. I kind of like that one too. I like that one too. Do you know what your name was going to be if it was up to your mother? Tyler. Yeah. You want to buy me a coffee someday? Well, we'll take the Saints name. But that's a good one. Thank you for that one. Yes, Tyler. She wanted to call you Ty. Ty. Oh, that's just precious. Not to rob it today. I just didn't, I know. I couldn't have it. Anyway. How's your day today? Oh, it was good. I mean, it was good. Okay. Yeah. Okay. You've been looking at the market a little bit today. What's the market doing today? E-minis are up about 15 NASDAQ. Up another 20. So you've been watching getting kind of engaged. Two weeks ago, when we first started this, three weeks ago, when we first started this, did you ever look at the market before or anything like that? Not really. Not really. And you were in the finance field, right? Yeah. Yeah. And a finger of the finance field, right? Mm-hmm. It's amazing, right? Like how things can change so much, like something that's been around for basically forever, you know, you don't really like look at it and watch it. And now it consumes, you know, your day while you're doing your other job. Mm-hmm. Two. But you do a good job on supporting everything. All right. So let's take a look at your account today, okay? So the first thing I want to take a look at is, let's just go to Do. And before we find the trade, and we have an idea of a trade that we want to go to, first thing I want to do is always just look at your overall account. Again, we're just going to that, like that green area there, also up on the top left there where it says that 66% that's your overall portfolio's probability of profit. Like that to be over 50%. Ideally wrapped around 68%. Because that's basically standard deviation. Um, like to have in a perfect world, is a perfect world. This is not like what happens. Like if it may affect, if you looked at your account two days ago, your green area was more, more bullish because the market had been going a little bit lower. Now it's more in the middle of, uh, the middle of the range. Okay. So I like everything that's happening with your account, probably of profit, everything else like that. You only have, you know, four, three or four or five trades, um, in your account. So we want to put on another trade in your account. What's the first thing that you would do and what I like to do every time I'm looking to make a trade? You're under the grid. Okay. And then, uh, like to, uh, filter out earnings and, um, set our IV range, IVR range to be 50 to 100. So we'll, uh, we'll do, uh, yeah, 50 to 100 there. And then the earnings range will be, uh, 23 days. So we don't want earnings within 23 days right now or 45 is our, um, this is what I want to talk about a little bit today. So 45 is our, is our wheelhouse. Now, with 23 days left to expiration, which you are correct in August of 23 days, we're kind of, we're kind of in like no man's land in my eyes, because you have 51 days to September. I don't like to trade the weeklies on a longer term basis, longer term basis for us is 45 days. So I prefer if I could, especially as a new trader, like I'm trying to think about like you and everybody else will be listening to this as a new trader, I would rather default to closer to 45, which would bring us to 51 days. All things being equal. Okay. Does that make sense? So let's change that from 45 days to 51 days, which gets us to expiration. Because if we set it to 45 days, and a stock has earnings 47 or 48 or 49 days, inside that September expiration, it would be filtering it out and kind of give us a false reading. So if I go to expiration with 51 days, it's going to have no earnings inside that 51 days. Okay. I don't think it's going to change anything here, but I think it's just good mechanics. Yeah. And I actually had a chat today about the same idea, and one of the other things that I came up with, well, that I thought about was also the liquidity at, you know, wouldn't you prefer to go to the more, if you're in the middle of that range, where you have two expressions that are one outside the 45 range, one inside the range. Much tighter. Wouldn't you want to go to one that has more liquidity? You sure will. But let me, I'll just tell you, the front month with 20 summer days is always going to be more liquid than the back month. Just because at the back month, there are a lot of things. Just more people watching it. And also all the trades that have been made for the last 20 summer days, everybody's looking to make new ones adjust, close, open, tweak. There's always going to be a lot more liquidity and probably tighter markets in the shorter term, regular monthly options. Okay. So yeah, you want it, and it's in liquidity as king, but you kind of take a little liberty with the overall rule. Okay. Sounds good. Let's just click on that. Alright, so the top one, new month mining, 92% was actually 100 last couple of days, or close to 100. So it's actually come down a little bit, not a lot. At 92, it still is high. You'll notice that FCX was 100. It's down to 80. Now that's the last trade that you made. New month mining, FCX, both in the same type of field, gold mining, exploration, worldwide, blah, blah, blah. This stock was actually, have you watched it a little bit today? You actually sent me an IM. What did you really want to say? About 30 or 40 minutes ago, I was like, all right, I want to do any, I'm like, I want to do a cover call strategy, it's similar to what we did in FCX. And why do you want to do a cover call strategy? I mean, it's in that, obviously, the IVR is high. So, you know, selling that short call option, you know, I'm getting high premium value for that. Okay. And then it's a lower value stock price. So, I'm not, it doesn't cost me a ton to do it. I mean, it would be... Perfect. Perfect to sit, man. High implied volatility, low stock price. Perfect. That's all simple, some stuff. We're going to have to complicate it. It's perfect, did great. Okay, so, if we had an FCX trade on, which is basically in the same field, and you already have a gold iron condor trade on, then I probably wouldn't be looking at this trade. I'd be trying to look at something else. Makes sense? I just to not have all our X in the same type of... Call of correlated. Call of correlation. Don't want to have a correlated portfolio. Makes sense? All right, let's double click on an EM. I always take a little Wizard of Oz when I set an EM. I don't know why. I think it's an ATM. You know, I'm going to have to deposit a Vases. Okay. Strategy, you said, covered call. So, let's click on strategy. And let's go down to covered stock. And you can see in the advanced settings there, if we're in the right month, you can change it if you want to. So, let's make that 45 days. And as long as you have the weeklies unclicked on the right there, it's going to default to the closest monthly to 45 days, which is going to be September. So, you can always have that set at 45, and I guess we'll do the math for you. Okay, let's click go. So, we're looking to buy stock. That's the gray one... I'm sorry, the green one, that's kind of like a little bit lighter, just to show you that you're buying stock. So, the $1,1663 is probably the mid price of the offer. And then you're looking to sell the $18 call of defaults to the first call out of the money. Totally a complete and good setup. $16.55 is what you're paying for it, so what do you think your break even is? Put a circle of something around $16.55 you could. Is $16.55, that's my break even. All right, it's perfect. Not a trick question, I'm not trying to trick you anything else like that. You can also see where that red line is, and if you click, I think if you click that dollar sign, it'll also tell you how much like your buying power is, but it tells you your break even. Now, your buying power on this is not $1600. We don't have access to your back end in your account, so we default to the highest that it can be. And that would be like an IRA account. You'd be spending $654. And the highest here is the max loss. So, I mean... You're highest here is $1655. The stock could go to zero, I mean, it's been around since the 1900s. It could go to zero, but I doubt it. The brokerage firm holds about $300. No, excuse me, for a covered call about $500 to make this trade. Okay. All right, so you're risking $500. That's what I would think my max risk is to make how much? It'll be whatever I'm selling the call for, so $105. Plus... Plus... Well, you know what? Let's just do the math for you. Just click on it. All right, so your max profit on here is going to be $146. It's the difference between where the stock is right now. It was around $17.60 or something like that. The call strike, which is 18, so that's $40. Plus the 105 or 108 that you are selling the call for for a total of $143, $145, depending on how the stock is moving. So it's not just how much you're selling the call for because you're low on the stock. It's the difference between the stock and that call strike. Remember, the strike is where somebody is willing... You're getting somebody the right to buy your stock at. So you're giving them the right to buy it at 18. It's trading at $17.60, so you can make $40 there. But you're charging them some sort of premium. That premium was the $105 for the call. So you can make a total of around $145 on this covered call. I would unclick that for a quick second. And we're almost running out of time. About a 60%-59% probability of success. This is the classic thing that we did last time, classic covered call. Can I show you what Naked put for a moment? Okay, let's just unclear this and then sell the 17-put for me. Okay, so the 17-put has about a 65% probability of success. Slightly more. You're selling this for 93 cents. So what's your max profit? 93. 93 cents. What would be your break even? It'll be at whatever the strike is now minus the 93 cents. Which brings you to $16.07? Yeah. Right? Yeah, $16.70. $16.07. No, $16.70. We're at 93 cents. Stocks at 17.61. Ah, forget about the stock. You're not doing anything with stock here. You're just selling a put. A put when you sell a put, an easy way to think about it is, somebody can put stock to you. They can put stock to you at your strike price, which is 17. But you're charging them premium. You're charging them $93. So that $93 is yours. That's yours to keep, yours to have right now. So if somebody puts stock for you at 17, but you charge them $93, you break even 16.07. Okay. Now just click the button for a quick second. I mean, it does all the math for you. It's all here for you. But it's so much better. Like, I used to hate the Analyze tab on Toss, because people would use it as a crutch. If you could do the math and understand it, well, if you could do the math, then you understand it. If you look at a picture, it's a great visual, but I'm not sure you understand it. Does that make sense? Because just read off a calculator. All right. So let's go back to that trade. Which one do you want to do? Let's weigh them out. One, you make around $93 on, but you have a 65% probability of success, and a lower break even, which is good for you. The other one, you can make $145, have a higher, have a lower probability of success, and a lower break even point. Meaning, I shouldn't say lower breaking up. Your break even is closer, meaning, higher probability that you can get touched. I mean, honestly. This one uses $300. The other one uses $500. All things being equal, there's not a huge variance. You're 100% correct. Yeah, I would go, in my opinion, because I want to take a little bit more risk, I would go at the cover call, and give myself a little bit more potential. You know, potential profits. Perfect. There's no wrong answer. Because the setup, the mechanics work. So let's take a quick second here, and let's just kind of review what we went through. And the only thing that we tried to discuss here today was a difference between a covered call, and a short put, naked put. They're both bullish positions. They both want the same thing to happen. They've both very similar in break even points. One was about $0.50 higher than the other one. They both use around the same amount of money. They both use around $1,600. The caveat I would put towards this, you're in a margin account. So it's about the same trade. If you'll as in an IRA account, I'd probably do the covered call, because it uses just about the same amount as buying power as the naked put. But the covered call I can make $145, and the naked put I can only make about $94. Makes sense? Yeah. Good job, Addy. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. What do I say? Peace. Peace.

Transcript:  We're back. Where do I start? Bat versus bat. How are you son? Doing well today. How are you? Very good. Why are you doing so well today? I was a little excited when during the new research segment this morning they did a new new month on a call. Which we placed yesterday. Correct. So that they validated what we were going through and one of their picks that they had on a previous show. I agree with you. I look at this kind of melancholy on that trade because they were getting in at a better price. Because the stock was down about 30 cents or so when they placed it. I think your accounts actually do not care. I think that new mountain mining trades only down small. Let's take a look if we could. Yeah. Okay. So you're down small. It looks like in new mountain mining. Okay. It's okay. Overall position is doing pretty good. You're up about $115 or so. You're down a couple bucks today about 30 bucks or something like that today. All right. You've got you've got an overall basically delta neutral position to be favor. Unclick. Click everything back on just so you can see all of his positions. Great. And close up the tighten up the window up. Thank you. Open up one more time. They go on the right hand side there. It shows you a beta weighted delta is your short two delta. I consider that extremely flat. Because you're extremely flat, let's look at that green curve there in your risk profile. You obviously make a little bit more money on a couple of your positions if we go a little bit higher. Okay. So yes, you're neutral. But you really got kind of a bullish stance a little bit. So I want to neutralize that a little bit. But you wanted to put on a trade. So I want to look at what you want to do because you found it. Yeah. We're, I mean, we're comparing the difference between just selling a naked put and doing the short call covered. Stock yesterday. And how they were like similar buying power. And so one of the things that I was looking at was just like where I would, you know, so many how it's so put in. And keeping with what we've been doing and just kind of like, you know, staying mechanical, I pulled up the grid and, and you know, searched through. For stocks with no earnings in the next 45 days. And so you used high volume, right? Because I usually use the notable list, which is fine. Yeah, I like to use the high volume. You can make your own list in here also. I mean, you can curate your own list. But okay, go ahead. Well, I mean, the notable stock list, those stocks also appear. Up here, if you use the high option volume, I mean, it just for me, it just gives me like a bigger group. It is, it is a larger amount of stocks. Yeah. Okay. Cool. And so the one that I was looking at was CNX, which is a toll energy mining. You know, group they are an energy sector. Okay. I've got a ton of gold positions, or not a ton, but I've done three gold positions so far. And I got a couple. What do you mean by three of an iron condor in GLD, right? Yeah. And we had the FCX position that we closed out. So that was our gold. So we've done three things in gold. So I figured I would do some some energy. And when we were actually looking at this, it was down 17 or 13 cents on the day. And it's been since I pulled it up. It's been moving up. But. Okay. So you got a high, high implied IV rank stock, 95%. Some I tight liquids, not a stock I trade all the time. Lower price stock, 16, $1,74. You want to sell and make it put. Stocks been beaten up. I remember correctly, it's been beaten up a lot, probably been cut in half the last year or so. So you want to catch what we call a falling knife, which is perfect. I mean, I like that. I mean, I can't buy the trend. I'd rather get it at a discount. That's the way that's the way I look at it. Yeah. Okay. So there you go. Yeah. So it's definitely been taken last year from 40 down to, you know, 16 or 17. Okay. Sounds great to me. Let's do it. Okay. So we're going to do the 50 day of the September monthly. And you're just going to sell and make it put. Yeah. Okay. So in the advance column, you can, um, you can set it to a probability of being out of the money that you kind of want. So let's go to 75% and see what happens. You want to. Okay. Okay. Let's, let's remove the weaklies too so that it goes. Perfect. Um, good catch. To the closest, uh, monthly to 50 days. Which is September. I think September is exactly 50. It won't click for some reason. All right. We'll just click go if we have to move it. It might not have any weaklies. I think that's a problem. Okay. Doesn't have any weaklies. So we'll let you click off the weaklies. All right. So that it brings up the 12 puts, uh, 36 cents. Is that seemed like an acceptable, uh, credit to receive? No. Um, I want to be in a, at 14. Okay. That was the one that I was, I was looking at. Um, it's been flipping in and out of liquidity. Um, and you're talking about the little circle there or the little, uh, Yeah, the range drop, the range drop, the, uh, the orange one. Um, and so it's been kind of dropping out of liquidity. I mean, I figured, you know, if we put it on and it doesn't get filled, it doesn't get filled and. So what's the only thing that you can control? Entry is your entry. So you know already that the markets are a little bit wide, not extremely wide, but a little bit wide. I get it. Stocks are rallying up a little bit. So there's, there's no reason why you have to put it in a mint price. You can put in any price you want. So why don't we go above the market? Let's click it up to around 74 cents. Okay. So now we'll put, uh, we'll put it in a 74 cents credit. So the stocks can have to move, uh, let's see, stocks can have to move about about 23 cents or so for you to get filled. I'm just going to buy the delta of the option. Okay. Does that sound good? Yeah. Okay. Or volatility expand a little bit. Mm-hmm. Stock goes a little bit lower, volatility expands a little bit. Okay. All right. All right. Beautiful. Let's push it through. Okay. That's just $1300 in buying power. It really only takes a couple hundred dollars in buying power. That's a few word and IRA type account. Okay. And it's, uh, I'm told that color is fuchsia. I don't know what color I would call it, but they tell me that it's fuchsia. Did you use the yellow one? Yeah, I think so. I don't know. Isn't like fuchsia like a purple red something? I don't know. Okay. He told me it was fuchsia. Unless I'm lying. She was lying to me. It was a bit of a cruel joke for four years. I don't know. She had the big box of crayons growing up. Yeah. The spatistas had the, the 10 pack, right? The red, blue, green, black. That was it. And there's a joke. I'm not going to say it. All right. So I've got a, I know who's kidding. I had the 74 pack with the sharpener. I was going to say it with the sharpener. Yeah. It was so jealous of that. All right. So, all right. So I have a trade fee. Okay. So going back to your overall risk graph, we had a little bit, uh, you had more, more profit to the upside. And that's really a butterfly that you have on. It's not fair to micro manage your, your account when you have, you know, a limited amount of trades off four or five trades. All right. But let's, let's go along with the whole scenario, because we're building it, right? All right. I got a, we're at market extremes near highs. We've had a nice rally. I want to play the contrarian role again. I want to go into, I want to go into an ETF that's going to benefit from a down move, something like the spiders. Now, I want to, we can just, for the sake of saving time, I know I'm about seven minutes. Um, let's just go to the trade page and SPY. Just from this trade page, you tell me what you, what you see. Um, I mean, it's not too much on the screen. There's no option pricing. There's nothing else. I mean, it's low IVR. Perfect. Stop right there. So we can't use all of the strategies that you've already done so far, because all of the strategies that you've done have been for. Hi, IVR. Okay. So I've got a, I have some interest to you. Okay. I didn't want to go horizontal, meaning two different months until I explained to you what a calendar spread is and a diagonal spread is in a little more in depth. Maybe have some cards to support it. So I want to show you a trade in just one month that's similar to a trade you did, a butterfly, but it's kind of what we call skewed. And you can skew a butterfly in many different ways. Do you remember what a butterfly is? Well, we did the one in Netflix where we still have it on. Yeah. Oh, and we skewed it to the upside where we had an embedded short call. To the downside, actually. We skewed it to the downside. So there was no risk to the downside. It was only to the upside past our longest strike. You were 100% correct. We did a, we bought a call spread that was a little bit closer to the money. Five dollars wide and sold a ten dollar wide call spread. So we had no risk to the downside. But we wanted the stock to actually rally a little bit to 150. Yeah, but kind of staying that, that kind of staying that range. So the volatility contraction play because you're selling it out of the money call spread. All right. If we, if we have a low implied volatility is not too many things we can do. Calendar spread, diagonal spread, or debit spread. Do you remember we talked about a debit spread a little bit? Do you remember? I wonder what we want to risk one to make one. Yeah. So I don't want to, we're buying, paying for it. Right, we don't want to pay anything, no extrinsic value over the price of the stock. All right. So let's go to, do me a favor, go to the table view for a moment. And then we'll come right back to the, to the curvy, because the curvy kind of gives you the answers for a moment. All right. For the sake of time, because we only got a couple of minutes, let's do what we always talk about. The stock is trading at around $211. So we always look to buy an option, one or two strikes in the money. And sell an option, one or two strikes out of the money. Let's go $2 in the money to $213. Let's buy the $213 put. Want to be, want to be on the downside, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. And let's sell an option that's one or two strikes out of the money. Let's go to the 109 put. Okay. That spreads trading for, it looks like for about $1.60 in change. Do you see that? Mm-hmm. Okay. So what's your break even on this trade? Um, so it'll be $1.16. $1.63 is what you do. $1.63. It's $4.00 wide spread. So it'll be $1.63 less the 2.13. I'm going to give you a quick little, quick little math thing that my teacher and PS207 shout out to public school 207 in Marine Park, Brooklyn. $4.00 spread. Like, like, I'm going to make time to give you this test that we would give young guys that we were trying to. We asked one question that we were trying to hire. It's a $4.00 spread. Don't make it crazy. If you were paying $2, your break even would be $9.11. Right? 2.13 is the put your buying? Yes. If you were paying $2.00 for it would be $2.11, right? Yes. Okay. So for paying $2.163 then it's $11.43. $2.11.43. No. $2.11.43? Here, let's let the computer do it. Hit confirm and send one time. I have to send you to my school. So where's the break even? $2.11.38. All right. Close enough. Close enough right there. What do you mean I'm okay? I'm off. A nickel. It actually moved to penny off you. Yeah. But that's okay. So you were actually at $0.04. Don't make a difference. It's good. It's good. Yes. All right. It's like horse using hand grenades. Yeah. All right. So the stock is trading at under $2.11 and your break even is over $2.11. $2.11.38. Correct? Correct. So you're not paying any extrinsic value over the price of where the stock is trading at right now. Okay? Yeah. Okay. The my break even is above the current price. Perfect. So let's get rid of that for a second and unclick that. Now let's let's let's have a screen. Perfect. Now let's sell another 209 put. Like not to finance what we're paying, but let's sell another 209 put and buy a 207 put. So make you can either make that to or click on it. There you go. And let's buy a 207 put up on top. Perfect. So we're making a butterfly out of it. Kind of different. On your Netflix butterfly, we had an embedded short call spread. In here, we're actually buying a $4.00 wide put spread and selling a $2.00 wide put spread. It brings our price down to $1.18 from a $1.60 something. So it's going to make our break even further away from the stock price. Do you get that? Because now it's only the 2.13 minus the 1.18. Correct. Does that make sense? Yes. Are you okay with it so far? So what's our total risk on this trade? The total risk is what we're paying for it. The 1.18. Perfect. Awesome. What would be your possible profit on this trade? The $4.00 wide because that's the width of the largest side. Minus whatever we paid for it is the 1.18. Perfect. Perfect. So the difference between the two. So if we paid $1 for it, our profit would be 3. So if we paid $1.24, our profit would be 280. Yeah. All right. Just try and teach a quick math. Yeah. So we're at 282. Perfect. Perfect. Okay. Are you good so far? Yeah. Let's go to the curvy and take a look at this trade. Oh boy. Not a bad looking risk graph. It's still a 50-50 shot. But the stock can go a little bit lower. It can go almost anywhere down. It can go anywhere. And we don't have any loss. Yeah, we don't have any risk to the downside. Perfect. Okay. Let's do this trade. $1.17. Let's just go in at the mid price and see what happens. Who comes up next? Tonight. You did good to the A-Bud, all right? What do we say? Peace, peace.

Transcript:  We're back. Where do I start? Bat versus bat. How are you son? Doing well today. How are you? Very good. Why are you doing so well today? I was a little excited when during the new research segment this morning they did a new new month on a call. Which we placed yesterday. Correct. So that they validated what we were going through and one of their picks that they had on a previous show. I agree with you. I look at this kind of melancholy on that trade because they were getting in at a better price. Because the stock was down about 30 cents or so when they placed it. I think your accounts actually do not care. I think that new mountain mining trades only down small. Let's take a look if we could. Yeah. Okay. So you're down small. It looks like in new mountain mining. Okay. It's okay. Overall position is doing pretty good. You're up about $115 or so. You're down a couple bucks today about 30 bucks or something like that today. All right. You've got you've got an overall basically delta neutral position to be favor. Unclick. Click everything back on just so you can see all of his positions. Great. And close up the tighten up the window up. Thank you. Open up one more time. They go on the right hand side there. It shows you a beta weighted delta is your short two delta. I consider that extremely flat. Because you're extremely flat, let's look at that green curve there in your risk profile. You obviously make a little bit more money on a couple of your positions if we go a little bit higher. Okay. So yes, you're neutral. But you really got kind of a bullish stance a little bit. So I want to neutralize that a little bit. But you wanted to put on a trade. So I want to look at what you want to do because you found it. Yeah. We're, I mean, we're comparing the difference between just selling a naked put and doing the short call covered. Stock yesterday. And how they were like similar buying power. And so one of the things that I was looking at was just like where I would, you know, so many how it's so put in. And keeping with what we've been doing and just kind of like, you know, staying mechanical, I pulled up the grid and, and you know, searched through. For stocks with no earnings in the next 45 days. And so you used high volume, right? Because I usually use the notable list, which is fine. Yeah, I like to use the high volume. You can make your own list in here also. I mean, you can curate your own list. But okay, go ahead. Well, I mean, the notable stock list, those stocks also appear. Up here, if you use the high option volume, I mean, it just for me, it just gives me like a bigger group. It is, it is a larger amount of stocks. Yeah. Okay. Cool. And so the one that I was looking at was CNX, which is a toll energy mining. You know, group they are an energy sector. Okay. I've got a ton of gold positions, or not a ton, but I've done three gold positions so far. And I got a couple. What do you mean by three of an iron condor in GLD, right? Yeah. And we had the FCX position that we closed out. So that was our gold. So we've done three things in gold. So I figured I would do some some energy. And when we were actually looking at this, it was down 17 or 13 cents on the day. And it's been since I pulled it up. It's been moving up. But. Okay. So you got a high, high implied IV rank stock, 95%. Some I tight liquids, not a stock I trade all the time. Lower price stock, 16, $1,74. You want to sell and make it put. Stocks been beaten up. I remember correctly, it's been beaten up a lot, probably been cut in half the last year or so. So you want to catch what we call a falling knife, which is perfect. I mean, I like that. I mean, I can't buy the trend. I'd rather get it at a discount. That's the way that's the way I look at it. Yeah. Okay. So there you go. Yeah. So it's definitely been taken last year from 40 down to, you know, 16 or 17. Okay. Sounds great to me. Let's do it. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, let's go to 75% and see what happens. You want to do the 50 day of the September monthly. And you're just going to sell and make it put. Yeah. Okay. So in the advance column, you can, you can set it to a probability of being out of the money that you kind of want. So let's go to 75% and see what happens. You want to? Okay. Okay. Let's remove the weeklies too so that it goes. Perfect. Okay. Okay. To the closest monthly to 50 days, which is September, I think September is exactly 50. It won't click for some reason. All right. We'll just click go if we have to move it. It might not have any weeklies. I think that's the problem. Okay. It doesn't have any weeklies. So it won't let you click off the weeklies. All right. So that it brings up the 12 puts 36 cents. Is that seem like an acceptable credit to receive? No. I wanted to be in at 14. Okay. That was the one that I was looking at. Okay. It's been flipping in and out of liquidity. And you're talking about the little circle there or the little... Yeah. The range drop. The range drop. The little orange one. And so it's been kind of dropping out of liquidity. I mean, I figured, you know, if we put it on and it doesn't get filled, it doesn't get filled. So what's the only thing that you can control? Entry. Is your entry. So you know already that the markets are a little bit wide. Not extremely wide, but a little bit wide. I get it. Stocks are rallying up a little bit. So there's no reason why you have to put it in a mint price. You can put in any price you want. So why don't we go above the market? Let's click it up to around 74 cents. Okay. So now we'll put it in a 74 cents credit. So now we're going to have to move... Let's see. It's actually going to have to move about 23 cents or so for you to get filled. I'm just going to buy the delta of the option. Okay. Does that sound good? Yeah. Okay. Or volatility will expand a little bit. Stock goes a little bit lower, volatility expands a little bit. Okay. All right. All right. Beautiful. Let's push it through. Okay. That's just $1300 in buying power. It really only takes a couple hundred dollars in buying power. That's a fewer in an IRA type account. I'm told that color is fuchsia. I don't know what color I would call it, but they tell me that it's fuchsia and it's... Is it the yellow one? Yeah, I think so. I don't know. Isn't like fuchsia like a purple red something? I don't know. Okay. He told me it was fuchsia. Unless I'm lying. She was lying to me. It was a big cruel joke for four years. I don't know. She had the big box of crayons growing up. Yeah. The big box. The Batistas had the 10 pack, right? The red, blue, green, black. That was it. That's a joke. I'm not going to say it. All right. So I've got a... No, I know. Who's kidding? I had the 74 pack with the sharpener. I was going to say it with the sharpener. Yeah. It was so jealous of that. All right. So I have a trade fee. Okay. So going back to your overall risk graph, we had a little bit... We had more profit to the upside. That's really a butterfly that you have on. It's not fair to micro-manage your account when you have a limited amount of trades or five trades. All right. But let's go along with the whole scenario because we're building it, right? All right. I got a... We're at market extremes. Near highs. We've had a nice rally. I want to play the contrarian role again. I want to go into... I want to go into an ETF that's going to benefit from a down move, something like the spiders. Now, I want to... We can just... For the sake of saving time, because I know I'm going to go about seven minutes. Let's just go to the trade page in SPY. And just from this trade page, you tell me what you see. I mean, it's not too much on the screen. There's no option pricing. There's nothing else. I mean, it's low IVR. Perfect. Stop right there. So we can't use all of the strategies that you've already done so far. Because all of the strategies that you've done have been for... Hi, IVR. Okay....situations. So I've got a... I have something to interest you. Okay, I didn't want to go horizontal, meaning... Two different months, until I explained to you what a calendar spread is... And a diagonal spread is in a little more in depth. Maybe have some cards to support it. So I want to show you a trade in just one month... That's similar to a trade you did, a butterfly. But it's kind of what we call skewed. And you can skew a butterfly in many different ways. Do you remember what a butterfly is? Well, we did that. The one in Netflix, where we skewed. We still have it on. Yeah. And then we skewed it to the upside, where we had an embedded short call. To the downside, actually. We skewed it to the downside. So there was no risk to the downside. It was only to the upside. Past our longest strike. You were 100% correct. We did a... We bought a call spread that was a little bit closer to the money. Five dollars wide. And sold a ten dollar wide call spread. So we had no risk to the downside. But we wanted the stock to actually rally a little bit to 150. Yeah, but kind of staying that... That's very... We're saying that range. So the volatility contraction play, because you're selling and out of the money call spread. All right. If we have low implied volatility, there's not too many things we can do. Calendar spread, diagonal spread, or debit spread. Do you remember we talked about a debit spread a little bit? Do you remember? I wonder what we want to risk one to make one. Yeah. So I don't want to... We're buying, paying for it. Right. We don't want to pay anything, no extrinsic value over the price of the stock. All right. So let's go to... Do me a favor. Go to the table view for a moment. And then we'll come right back to the... To the curve view. Because the curve view kind of gives you the answers for a moment. All right. For the sake of time, because we only got a couple of minutes. Let's do what we always talk about. The stock is trading at around $211. So we always look to buy an option, one or two strikes in the money. And sell an option, one or two strikes out of the money. Let's go two dollars in the money to two thirteen. Let's buy the two thirteen put. You want to be on the downside, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. And let's sell an option that's one or two strikes out of the money. Let's go to the one or nine put. Okay. That spreads trading for... It looks like for about a dollar sixty in change. Do you see that? Mm-hmm. Okay. So what's your break even on this trade? Um, so it'll be a dollar sixteen... $1.63 is what you... $1.63. It's a four dollar wide spread. So it'll be a dollar sixty three less the two thirteen. I'm going to give you a quick little, quick little math thing that my teacher and PS207 shout out to public school 207 in Marine Park, Brooklyn. $4 spread. Like, like... I'm going to make Tom give you this test that we would give young guys that we were trying to. We asked one question that we were trying to hire. It's a four dollar spread. Don't make it crazy. If you were paying two dollars, your break even would be 9.11. Right? Two thirteen is to put your bank. Yes. If you were paying two dollars for it would be two eleven, right? Yes. Okay. So for paying two sixty or one sixty three then it's eleven... uh... eleven... 43. Two eleven forty three. No. Two eleven forty three. Here let's let the computer do it. Hit confirm and send one time. I have to send you to my school. So where's the break even? Two eleven thirty eight. Alright. Close enough. Close enough right there. What do you mean I'm... okay, I'm off. A nickel. Okay. It actually moved the penny off you. Yeah. But that's okay. Alright. So you were actually going to play four cents. It's good. It's good, it's good. Alright. It's like horse using hand grenades. Yeah. Okay. Alright. So the stock is trading at under two eleven and your break even is over two eleven. Two eleven thirty eight. Correct. Correct. So you're not paying any extrinsic value over the price of where the stock is trading at right now. Okay? Yeah. Okay. The my break even is above the current price. Correct. So let's get rid of that for a second and unclick that. Now let's... No. Let's have a screen. Perfect. Now let's sell another two oh nine put. Like not to finance what we're paying but let's sell another two oh nine put and buy a two oh seven put. So make you can either make that two or click on it. There you go. And let's buy a two oh seven put up on top. Perfect. So we're making a butterfly out of it kind of different. On your Netflix butterfly we had an embedded short call spread. In here we're actually buying a four dollar wide put spread and selling a two dollar wide's put spread. It brings our price down to a dollar eighteen from a dollar sixty something. So it's going to make our break even even further away from the stock price. Do you get that? Because now it's only the two thirteen minus the the one eighteen. Correct. Does that make sense? Yes. Are you okay with it so far? So what's our total risk on this trade? The total risk is what we're paying for it the one eighteen. Perfect. Awesome. What would be your possible profit on this trade? The one for the four dollar wide because that's the width of the of the largest side minus whatever we paid for it is the one eighteen. Perfect. Perfect. So the difference between the two. So if we paid one dollar for it our profit would be three. If we paid a dollar twenty for it our profit would be two eighty. Yeah. All right. Just try to teach you quick math. If you're too lazy to. Perfect. Perfect. Okay. Are you good so far? Yeah. Let's go to the curvy and take a look at this trade. Oh boy. Not a bad looking risk graph. It's still a fifty fifty shot. But the stock can go a little bit lower. It can go almost anywhere down. It can go anywhere. And we don't have any. Loss. Yeah. We don't have any risk to the downside. Perfect. Okay. Let's do this trade. Dollar seventeen. Let's just go in at the mid price and see what happens. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. You did good today, bud. All right. What do we say? Peace. Peace.

Transcript:  You Nicky when I start that versus bat how you son? Not too good today my my Today column is not very very green so speak That's the best answer that you've ever given me to an opening see cuz my day always starts and ends With how the market is doing that's how like I know what's going on It's not if the market's going up or if the market's going down It's whether my account is going up my account is going down So what you're saying is your account is going down today a little bit. Yeah, okay? I feel need a little bit, but it's okay. I click you've been here before to character builder It's it's a marathon not a quick little race. I really haven't been here yet though. I had it's that point. I've had to Small winners I would say I mean that's correct. You've only been doing this a month or less, right? Yeah, okay So it's right but net net your overall and your account your upright. Yes, you're up about a hundred fifty bucks on the high end I think you're up about yeah 80 bucks total now or so and yeah Today, yeah, let's take a look at your account real quick You got the e-mail s and p's down 1550 you got the Dow down almost a hundred and seventy points you can see how your How your risk graph kind of changes real quick with a hundred and seventy point down move or a fifteen point move in the e-mail S&Ps right your overall beta weighted deltas are still relatively nothing right I mean short six deltas is not what I consider You know long or short, but if you look at your risk risk graph you make a little bit more money to the upside now Put the curve put your cursor over the small red area there inside his risk curve. Okay, stop right there So it looks like let's just say the stock goes down a little bit more towards 205 or so and that's the S&P 500 you'd be down around it looks like about another What does that say about a hundred and Hundred bucks, let's say is that what it looks like it's a thousand and then two thousand so I mean just well it should say on the right hand side there I can't select the price two or five and you down 152 you're down about a hundred and fifty two bucks, right? Is that correct? Yeah, you would that yeah, okay, I just want to make sure now. Let's go about the same type area to the to the upside Let's go to Less no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I mean keep going. Yeah, let's just Right go up a little bit more perfect right there and if you're there you're up around 450 bucks If it goes to 210 if it goes to 210 So I mean you've got SPY around in the middle what I'm trying to show you is so okay So you have a portfolio that's basically neutral if we stay right here put your cursor right over the zero Perfect if you stay right here you make back about a hundred and sixty dollars if we go up about two three dollars at Expiration you know you make about four hundred bucks five hundred bucks and change if we go down two three dollars You lose about a hundred and fifty bucks that's trading Like two of the three ways you're gonna make money that's trading Not just like picking something to buy picking something to sell and hoping to be directly right does that kind of makes sense? Yeah, all right cool You've got a vacation coming you're gonna be off for the rest of the week right today's your last day of your week At the end I'll be here holding down the fort make it sure everything gets taken care of you enjoy yourself Being a son have some fun all right So I want to talk about your account going on vacation and what to do so you're actually in my eyes going on vacation The perfect time because there's 45 days left 46 days left till expiration that's our sweet spot So that means today for you it's business as usual and you actually have to get more than one trade on because you're gonna Miss four days worth of trading mm-hmm Does that make sense cool? Like a two trades for you to look at let's do them all right, okay? Let's go to first one. I want to go to is let's go to Apple a P L We can go to a chart of it too if you want to just take a quick look at it I'm gonna kind of go through these as quick as possible Twitter is will be the next one we'll look at Okay It's a year-to-date chart in apples down 10% over the last 10 days alone Um our research has shown that when a stock has a move that's about 10% or more in a short period of time Which we think is around 10 days we could be due for a little bit of a bounce Okay, let's with that in mind Ivy rank is 45 it was just above 50 not too long ago. Yeah, I saw it on the grid page when I was Playing around earlier in the day the stock was down about another dollar from here So it's kind of come back a little bit when it comes back volatility kind of contracts a little bit But if you notice like put a circle on the last time it had earnings not the most recent but the time back in April Okay, so what I'm trying to show you is put a circle that I'm sorry put it you don't You don't do the tools are working. Okay, so If you look at the in the bottom of the page there. I'm look at the ivy rank Last time it had earnings it was around a 50 somewhat percent ivy rank and then it went Quickly down to almost zero. Do you see the green line? Yeah, we're dropped. Okay, so now we go to where we where we just had earnings now So it's around the same area maybe a little bit less about 45 percent quickly jobs drops down to zero and then we're back at like earnings level Ivy rank so I look at this as like an opportunity an opportunity to sell premium in there. Mm-hmm makes sense. Yeah, all right Let's go to Apple a P. I will do it in dope be fine So what's your go what would be your go-to strategy you're going on vacation? Mm-hmm you have plenty of Money in your account to use what would be the strategy that you would use high implied volatility? What do you do? Well, I mean we could I mean we're gonna sell premium so I mean we could sell Strangle on it or okay, so we were selling premium or I mean since the the ivy are is On the lower end of the 50 scale what about if we did like another Like broken wing butterfly to the upside You so broken wing butterfly to the upside Quantified it for me like you know how we had we did that in Netflix where we kind of had zero downside risk What if we did that? Okay, so stop if I have zero downside risk like we did in Netflix Then that's actually the direction. I want the stock to go mm-hmm Does that make sense to you? Yeah, so so if I did a broken wing call butterfly We're at risk to the upside like we did in Netflix that I'd have to be neutral to bearish in Apple Apple's just had a 10% move down. I'm kind of neutral to bullish on it So if I want to do a broken wing butterfly then I would do it to the put side I want to put the risk to the side. I think the stock is not gonna go Yeah, so it makes sense. Yeah, so the puts if we did a pull it would go You know, we would have no risk to the upside if it goes past our that's correct That's correct. I don't hate that But I'd rather just do a strangle for you right now if that's okay. Cool. Is that all right? Yeah, okay? So let's skew it a little bit to the upside since you want since you seems like you want to be a little bit more bullish on it Is that yeah, I'm gonna try to read you we don't talk about this at a time. Yeah, I'm trying to read you Yeah, all right, so let's go to let's go to 45 days. It's fine. Let's go to one standard deviation Which would be my default go to click on go So it looks like with 45 46 days Okay, so do you see some let's see the stock is one let's just call it 119 that's the 105 puts that's 14 Strikes lower mm-hmm follow me so far. Yep, and we got 109 to 135 You're looking at 17 there. What's 16 or 17 strikes higher look at the prices on them You've got the call at 34 cents you got the put at 92 cents Mm-hmm. That's that's Like I'm not gonna sell a call for 34 cents. Does that make sense? There's not you're I mean, you're not getting a whole lot out of that. I don't think I am So let's let's the 105 put for 92 cents. Let's look at the 130 call. Let's go down five All right, so now you're about equal distance away you got about 12 points 11 and a half points to the upside and It looks like you've got about 13 13 and a half points to the downside But the prices are about equal all I'm trying to do is like, you know like how much am I willing to risk for my reward? Okay, so we got a dollar 69 you've got about a 72% probably success. That's perfect for us, right? Okay, you want to skew it a little bit to the upside? Let's see if we move that put from the 105 unfortunately There five yeah, there are five wide so we'd have to go to the 110 we have to go to the 110 or a different month a month with weekly is it I'm gonna prefer and I think you should prefer even in Apple that has liquid weekly markets Meaning they're about six seven cents wide that we stay in the month is it that are basically one penny wide So that okay, yeah, okay, so we're gonna give up some of the strike selection So you got the 110 130 and it's trading for $2.37 Mm-hmm I mean, I think if we're if we're gonna play Tor you know for a bounce to for the stock to increase You know, let's go with the 110 and and you know take the extra premium and you know if we're you know thinking that it's gonna go that direction Let's play that direction. Well, you just took off Costco Strangle that you had on this gonna use about the same amount of buying power that this is gonna use the Costco Strangle was about the same amount of premium That you received in it, but the strikes were a lot tighter. I don't know. I think it's a good use of capital or return Yeah, okay, I agree all right Let's go in a $2.37 and you can change it later if you want to because I'm running out of a little bit of time cool Let's go to Twitter. Let's go to a chart of it Now this is a stock that we've been long for some time the knock-in paid meff again killed in it Yeah, I mean it hasn't it hasn't stopped going down Well, it's got sideways for a while which has been kind of nice, but this moved down now I mean down 20% over the last 10 days trading near all-time Lose for the stock. I don't know bells and whistles go off in my head that you know Maybe we're due for a little bit of a bounce here now you have a Neutral to slightly bullish portfolio. We just put on a neutral trade. I want to put on another little bit of a bullish trade here In Twitter are you okay with that? Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay, so it's a relatively low-price stock So what I'm gonna try to do is I'm gonna try to give you like all the all the Little check marks that I'm looking at and then see if you can come up with like read my mind what what I'm thinking so you've got Decent implied volatility 44% if you look at the last time in add earnings and the time before I had earnings the IV rank went down to around zero Mm-hmm now the IV rank is 44% same thing that we saw in the apple same thing that you saw in apple so we've got a relatively low-price stock you've got a High volatility for the amount of time left You got a stock that hasn't had an uptick Let's go to a trade page of it. What type of strategy would you look for? Selling premium buying premium Selling premium selling premium. So what type of strategy would you look for? Um, well, I mean we just did a Strangle so I mean we could go to like a covered call like we did on our FCX and so we're thinking exactly the same Yeah, I think low-price stock high implied volatility covered call or naked put Same buying power like we just similar buying similar buying power reduction You could make more money with the Covered call you have a higher probability of success with the put Make sense. Yeah, okay You'll decide which one that you're gonna do in Twitter and if you're gonna pick one you're gonna look at September one strike out of the money on the call and one or two strikes out of the money in the put looking to collect around a dollar on the put Okay, make sense. Yeah between you know 90 cents and about 50 something like that. I'll tweet that out after the show good. Okay. Mm-hmm sound good I let's go let's just take a quick recap on what we discussed today So the first thing that we talked about was we just went over your overall account and then we also Looked at your own situation like you're going on a vacation is the rest of my portfolio okay Am I happy with everything I have you also have a nice Netflix trade on that you might think about closing You're up about 60 bucks on it. Yeah again, it's you have to go over your Account that you have and then take into consideration you got 45 days left to expiration That's the sweet spot. You're not gonna touch these trades anyway for a week or two So if you're gonna be on vacation what difference does it make yeah Business is usual business is usual very good son who comes up next tonight. What do I normally say peace?

Transcript:  Thank you. What do I start? Bat vs. bat. How are you, son? Not too good today. My today column is not very, very green, so speak. That's the best answer that you've ever given me to an opening. Because my day always starts and ends with how the market is going. That's how I know what's going on. It's not if the market's going up or if the market's going down. It's whether my account is going up or my account is going down. So what you're saying is your account is going down today. A little bit. Feeling the heat a little bit. But it's okay. I think you've been here before. It's a character builder. It's a marathon, not a quick little race. I really haven't been here yet, though. That's the point. I've had two small winners, I would say. I mean, that's correct. You've only been doing this a month or less, right? Yeah. Okay. Net net your overall and your account. Your up, right? Yes. You're up about 150 bucks on the high end. I think you're up about 80 bucks total now or so. Yeah. And it's down $80 today or so. Let's take a look at your account real quick. You got the EUNES and P's down 1550. You got the Dow down almost 170 points. You can see how your wrist graph kind of changes real quick with 170 point down move or 15 point move in the EUNES and P's, right? Your overall beta weighted deltas are still relatively nothing, right? I mean, short six deltas is not what I consider, you know, long or short. But if you look at your wrist graph, you make a little bit more money to the upside. Now, put your cursor over the small red area there inside his wrist curve. Okay. Stop right there. So it looks like, let's just say the stock goes down a little bit more towards 205 or so. And that's the S&P 500. You'd be down around, it looks like about another, what does that say, about a hundred and a hundred bucks, let's say. Is that what it looks like? I can't say for me. Well, it's a thousand and then two thousand. So, I mean, just. Well, it should say on the right hand side there, I can't select the price 205 and you got about 150 to you down about 152 bucks, right? Mm-hmm. Is that correct? Yeah. Is that how you would that? Yeah. Okay. So, about the same type of area to the, to the upside, let's go to less, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I mean, keep going, yeah, yeah. Let's just, right, go up a little bit more, perfect, right there. And if you're there, you're up around 450 bucks. If it goes to 210. If it goes to 210, so, I mean, you've got SPY around in the middle, why I'm trying to show you is so, okay, so you have a portfolio that's basically neutral. If we stay right here, put your cursor right over the zero area, perfect. If you stay right here, you make back about $160. If we go up about $2, $3 at expiration, you make about $400, $500 in change. If we go down $2, $3, you lose about 150 bucks. That's trading. Mm-hmm. Like two of the three ways you're going to make money, that's trading. Not just like picking something to buy, picking something to sell and hoping to be directly right. Does that kind of make sense? Yeah. All right, cool. You've got a vacation coming. You're going to be off for the rest of the week, right, today's your last day of your week. I don't know, I'll be here holding down the fort. Make it true, I really think it's taken care of you. You're going to enjoy yourself being a son, have some fun. All right, so I want to talk about your account going on vacation and what to do. So, you're actually, in my eyes, going on vacation the perfect time, because there's 45 days left, 46 days left, till expiration. That's our sweet spot. So that means today for you, it's business as usual. And you actually have to get more than one trade on, because you're going to miss four days worth of trading. Does that make sense? Cool. All right, so I've got two trades for you to look at. Let's do them. All right. Okay, let's go to, first one I want to go to is let's go to Apple, AAPL. We can go to a chart of it too if you want to just take a quick look at it. I'm going to kind of go through these as quick as possible. Twitter is, will be the next one we'll look at. Okay, a year-to-date chart in Apple, it's down 10% over the last 10 days alone. More research has shown that when a stock has a move that's about 10% or more in a short period of time, which we think is around 10 days, we could be due for a little bit of a bounce. Okay, let's, with that in mind, Ivy Rank is 45, it was just above 50, not too long ago. Yeah, I saw it on the grid page when I was playing around earlier in the day. The stock was down about another dollar from here, so it's kind of come back a little bit when it comes back, volatility kind of contracts a little bit. But if you notice, like put a circle around the last time it had earnings, not the most recent, but the time back in April. Okay, so what I'm trying to show you is, put a circle down, I'm sorry, put it, you don't do, the tool isn't working. Okay, so if you look at the, in the bottom of the page there, I'm looking at the Ivy Rank, last time it had earnings, it was around a 50-some-odd percent Ivy Rank, and then it went quickly down to almost zero. Do you see the green line? Yeah, we're dropped. Okay, so now we go to where we just had earnings now. So it's around the same area, maybe a little bit less about 45 percent, quickly drops down to zero, and then we're back at like earnings level Ivy Rank. So I look at this as like an opportunity, an opportunity to sell premium in there. Makes sense? Yeah. All right, let's go to Apple, AAP, I will do it in Dobe, be fine. So what's your go, what would be your go-to strategy, your going on vacation? You have plenty of money in your account to use, what would be the strategy that you would use? High implied volatility, what do you going to do? Well, I mean, we're going to sell premiums, so we could sell a strangle on it, or something where we're selling premium, or I mean, since the Ivy R is on the lower end of the 50 scale, what about if we did like another, like, broken wing butterfly to the upside? So, broken wing butterfly to the upside, quantified it for me, what would be the way? Like, you know how we had, we did that in Netflix where we kind of had zero downside risk, what if we did that? Okay, so stop. If I have zero downside risk, like we did in Netflix, then that's actually the direction I want the stock to go. Does that make sense to you? Yeah. So if I did a broken wing call butterfly, or risk to the upside, like we did in Netflix, then it had to be neutral to bearish in Apple. Apple just had a 10% move down. I'm kind of neutral to bullish on it. So, if I want you to do a broken wing butterfly, then I would do it to the put side. I want to put the risk to the side. I think the stock is not going to go. Yeah, so it makes sense? Yeah, so if we did a pull, it would go, you know, we would have no risk to the upside if it goes past our... That's correct. That's correct. I don't hate that. But I'd rather just do a strangle for you right now if that's okay. Cool. Is that all right? Yeah. Okay. So let's skew it a little bit to the upside since you want... Since you... Seems like you want to be a little bit more bullish on it. Is that... Yeah. I mean, I'm trying to read you. We don't talk about this ahead of time, so I'm trying to read you. Yeah. Alright, so let's go to 45 days. It's fine. Let's go to one standard deviation, which would be my default go to click on go. So it looks like with 45, 46 days. Okay. So do you see something? Let's see. The stock is one. Let's just call it one 19. That's the 105 puts. That's 14 strikes lower. Are you following me so far? Yep. And we got 109 to 135. You're looking at... 17 there. 16 or 17 strikes higher. Look at the prices on them. You've got the call at 34 cents. You've got the put at 92 cents. That's... I'm not going to sell a call for 34 cents. Does that make sense? I mean, you're not getting a whole lot out of that. I don't think I am. So let's... The 105 put for 92 cents. Let's look at the 130 call. Let's go down five. Alright, so now you're about equal distance away. You got about 12 points, 11 and a half points to the upside. And it looks like you've got about 13 and a half points to the downside. But the prices are about equal. All I'm trying to do is like, you know, like, how much am I willing to risk for my reward? Okay. So we got $1.69. You've got about a 72 percent probably success. That's perfect for us, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. You want to skew it a little bit to the upside? Let's see if we move that put from the 105. Unfortunately, the five... You know, you got the five wide, so we'd have to go to the 110. We'd have to go to the 110 or a different month, a month with a weeklies in it. I'm going to prefer, and I think you should prefer, even in Apple, that has liquid weekly markets, meaning they're about six, seven cents wide, that we stay in the monthly that are basically one penny wide. Is that okay? Yeah. Okay. So we're going to give up some of the strike selections. So you've got the 110, 130, and it's trading for $2.37. Mm-hmm. I mean, I think if we're going to play for a bounce for the stock to increase, you know, let's go with the 110 and take the extra premium, and if we're thinking that it's going to go that direction, let's play that direction. Well, you just took off Costco strangle that you had on it. Yeah. You're going to use about the same amount of buying power that this is going to use. The Costco strangle was about the same amount of premium that you received in it, but the strikes were a lot tighter. I don't know. I think it's a good use of capital or return. Yeah. I agree. I think it's going to be $3.37 and you can change it later if you want to because I'm running out of a little bit of time. Cool. Let's go to Twitter. Let's go to a chart of it. Now, this is a stock that we've been long for some time. The knock-it-and-paid mefak again killed in it. Yeah. I mean, it hasn't stopped going down since it's like a wide run. Well, it's going sideways for a while, which has been kind of nice, but this moved down now. I mean, down 20% over the last 10 days, trading near all time lows for the stock. I don't know. Bells and whistles go off in my head that maybe we're due for a little bit of a bounce here. Now, you have a neutral, a slightly bullish portfolio. You just put on a neutral trade. I want to put on another little bit of a bullish trade here in Twitter. Are you okay with that? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So, relatively low-price stock. So what I'm going to trade is I'm going to try to give you all the little check marks that I'm looking at and then see if you can come up with, like, read my mind, what I'm thinking. So you've got decent implied volatility, 44%. If you look at the last time in that earnings and the time before I had earnings, the IV rank went down to around zero. Now the IV rank is 44%. Same thing that we saw in the Apple. Same thing that you saw in Apple. So we've got a relatively low-price stock. You've got a high volatility for the amount of time left. You got a stock that hasn't had an uptick. Let's go to a trade page of it, what type of strategy would you look for? Selling premium by premium. Selling premium. Selling premium. So what type of strategy would you look for? Well, I mean, we just did a strangle. So I mean, we could go to, like, a cover call, like we did on our FCX. So we're thinking exactly the same. Yeah. I think low-price stock, high implied volatility, covered call, or naked put. Same buying power, like we just, similar buying power. Similar buying power reduction. You could make more money with the covered call. You have a higher probability of success with the put. Makes sense? Yeah. Okay, you'll decide which one that you're going to do in Twitter. And if you're going to pick one, you're going to look at September, one strike out of the money on the call, and one or two strikes out of the money in the put. Making to collect around a dollar on the put. Okay. Makes sense? Yeah. Between, you know, 90 cents and about 50, something like that. I'll tweet that out after the show. Good. Good. Okay. Mm-hmm. Sound good? Yeah. Let's just take a quick recap on what we discussed today. So the first thing that we talked about was we just went over your overall account. And then we also looked at your own situation. Like, you're going on a vacation. Is the rest of my portfolio okay? Am I happy with everything I have? You also have a nice Netflix trade on that you might think about closing. You're about 60 bucks on it. Yeah. Again, it's, you have to go over your account that you have. And then take into consideration. You got 45 days left to expiration. That's the sweet spot. You're not going to touch these trades anyway for a week or two. So if you're going to be on vacation, what difference does it make? Yeah. Business is usual. Business is usual. Very good, son. Who comes up next? Tonight. What do I normally say? Peace. Peace.

Transcript:  I Make you a finally back where do I start that versus bat look we're the same color now. Oh come on I think I got you now a little bit Pretty close pretty close if a nice vacation. I did what's the vacation feel like? Um, it was great. I mean great great. Hold on a second. It was great. It's great. Your vacation was great It's up first let's take a look at your account for me My account was not great. That was not great. Everything I do revolves around how may account it Let's take a look at your account how do you account do this last week? Not good. It was better today, but It's better today today you're up around 350 bucks, but you lost about 450 $500 total on your overall account you went from up around a hundred dollars 50 bucks to 100 bucks depending on how things were marked and now you're down 50 dollars today But you but today's P&L is nice it up 350 bucks. Yeah, it's it's net your down 50 dollars on everything that you close Everything else. Yeah, alright, so I want to do like some portfolio review on because that's how we left Last week when when you left going over everything saying hey, you know We like everything that we saw let's go over what we still have and see if our opinion hasn't changed on that Okay, let's just click on Apple So Apple you have basically a strangle with the stock right at 120 Right in between it's right in between so that's what you want right so you don't see that's an easy decision to make Yeah, right because Apple's rally four dollars today And you actually have a profit in there of around $65 on the overall trade that you put in so you're gonna close that actually Pretty soon you want to make about 50% of your possible profit. Let's get out of that next one CNX Okay, um, it's one of my dogs. It's one of your dogs you're down about a hundred dollars on the trade So I was almost gonna say like a silly $15 stock, but as you can see any stock whether it's a you know a hundred dollar stock hundred and twenty dollar stock like Apple or a fifteen dollar stock like CNX they all these options can grow teeth Yeah, so you have to be careful them. Okay, so What do you want to do here? So you long about 60 shares of stock at 60 delta's 58 dollars 58 delta's you know when I looked at it It still got a really high IVR and it you know the one thing that I was thinking was like is there anything That we can continue you know sell in there to kind of Help the position at all. Okay, so so what you're saying is and you're on sorry Did you we don't talk about this ahead of time? So did you come up with this yourself you talk to the team? What did you I mean? I was just kind of playing around honestly. I was using the great. I want you always to be honest with me on this Yeah, no, no, I don't ever I don't ever want you to have to say again to be honest with you because that implies that you're not being honest other times So I want you to be honest with me forever on this show always okay But I was looking at like Selling if we could sell a call and add you know more premium You know call is is the opposite way and they would create a strangle. It's still be outside my You know my my two strikes, but you know, I was collecting a little bit a premium there then if it goes up a little bit you know Stop stop stop. I like exactly what you're saying don't don't put yourself in a wormhole So what you're saying is I have 60 shares of directional risk 57 and change Okay, you know you have one contract so it sounds small if it was 10 contracts it'd be 570 same kind of risk You know your account would probably be larger, but it's the same proportional risk So 57 shares might sound like small 570 might sound like a lot. They're basically the same thing Mm-hmm. Okay, so so you're saying is I'd rather get rid of some of that directional risk and add a little premium because C and X still has a high IV rank yes, I like it. Let's go into let's go to the trade page and go to CNX You've got a 92% IV rank totally fits you're lucky that you still have 39 days left to September So you're kind of in that same type of time frame that we would open a trade so you have a lot more For lack of a better word you have a lot more options to do like you have a lot more things to do if this was 11 days to go It's like it's closer role, you know like you can't sell anything because you know the option to be trading for 20 cents 10 cents or We're nothing even make sense. Yeah, okay, so let's look at what we can do So the first thing I would look to do is well what's the first thing you would look to like what's called you want to do? What kind of strategy would I want to do well you said you want to sell a call against it, right? I was looking to sell call cuz I you know What strike The one I was looking at was like the 17 I think there wasn't a lot of liquidity here. So in like the same The liquidity is there the markets only three four cents wide the liquidity is there It's 33 cents for the 17 So that I mean that you're not using any more buying power yeah, okay? So it just it just is is that acceptable number for you Well, let's move what are we at it? So you're okay, that's good. That's perfect just to compare So 76% Well the delta here I can do it here hold on one second. So what I want to look at is like what's the delta on that option? So the delta on the 16 option is 30 I'm just rounding you had 60 you'd be cutting your delta in half We like to cut out delta by one third to one half Okay, so that's in that I mean that would fit the only thing that I would say to you at this point with 39 days to go and you Certainly could is if you go below 15 you start getting inverted Meaning that your put is gonna be In the money and your call is gonna start to be in the money if the stock were to rally So with 39 days to go I would love for you to be above 15 So if you were to tell me any option above 15 I'd be happy with it the 15 call has a 40 delta You had about 57 delta so you'd be taking on a little bit more than 50% about 70% of your delta. What do you want to do? Well if I take on more that premium with the with the 16 Wouldn't that give me more opportunity like if you know, let's say that if cnx goes up by 10 or 15 cents tomorrow 10 or 15 cents not gonna make a difference gonna be a perfect play Yeah, wouldn't I be able to like kind of almost scratch out of it? With you play for scratch No, but I mean it's delta risk I love I love what you're working through it. It's delta risk versus premium received But let's think about what we would what happens if we add this trade. There's no extra buying power We're getting rid of some delta risk. So if you don't like the delta risk in cnx 60 delta You can reduce it by about two thirds 42 delta's 40 delta's minus the 60 delta's that you have about a little more than half that's the that's the play It's the 16 or the 17 call Personally, I like the 16 call just for the 50 cents versus the 30 cents Okay, let's do that then let's go So let's go in the bit is 53 the offers 57. Let's go in at 56 and see what happens. Okay, you can always change it later on Okay So now all around the world your tiny little one lot the smallest you can get is gonna change the market For all eternity gonna make this market 53 56 that's your offer No, that's really that's your offer now like you're you're changing Wall Street with your option your trade It's pretty impressive. Let's go back to your trade page running out of time ready. Okay, GLD That one's finally moved into into your range. Yeah, it's my right. So you don't think there's anything to do. No sounds good to me any That one was in my range too, but it's The price I got it. I was like 1760 something so because it's a covered call. It's a cover call Right that's showing there on Doza covered call with the stock. Yeah, so you're down about 20 bucks on this trade Yeah, so we'll sit okay, okay, let's go in the Netflix Netflix we've moved outside your range you're down around 150 or 160 bucks on the trade defined risk trade You want the stock to go down about four five dollars? Mm-hmm. I don't know. I think you sit. Yeah, so sound good to you Yeah, I mean this is close right and I don't want to close it for a loss So we'll say you only have 11 days left to that Netflix trades Okay, SPY that's your short delta trade This is the probably the only one that in hindsight which is such a terrible word You could have closed because this is a bearish position. Yeah, you are up around $70 on the trade half would have been about a hundred bucks So you can't kill yourself about that. I mean you might not have kept the other positions you had on if you didn't have this one on That makes sense. Mm-hmm. Let's get out of SPY TLT dog dog Okay, so your your your put spread is basically worthless, right? I mean it's two cents That was the one I wanted to put on originally you want to sell put spread correct you down about $70 on the iron condor Yeah, what can you do if anything here? Well, it's to find risk so we're not so you don't have to do anything. Yeah, mm-hmm May I guess you could Get rid of the the puts I mean like so so that's our worthless So you could buy back you could buy back your naked put and that wouldn't free up any buying power because you're not You don't get relief you have relief on both sides So so you only getting you only have margin on one side So you would be you'd still have one side on okay? So you take off the put for two cents pay no commission for that because if you just put the naked option for under a nickel There's no commission so that's something you could do But then that just leaves you with a call spread that's right at the money what you could do is you could roll the call spread To the following month September and if you could do that for even or a small credit That might be something you'd want to do Okay, so all you're doing is this extending duration Okay, so giving a chance to go Give a chance for TLT below that's correct. Yeah, a little bit of credit It kind of gives us a little more wiggle room exactly not a lot of wiggle room But a little bit but it extends duration by 39 days because this is gonna be over in 11 days So let's when we're done when you're done with the show Let's look to roll the call spread just the call side and close the naked put okay? If you can't roll for a credit just leave it alone or even you're probably gonna have to probably probably a small debit Anyway, we'll take a new trade for you because you need new trades. We were behind. Let's go to win WH Sorry WYNN and I'm just gonna make it really simple because or really fast because we'll have about two minutes I don't want to eat Tim's time 57% IV rank In our range in our IV rank range 39 days to go to expiration still good. Let's just do a strangle a real wide one Let's go to strangle strangle seem to be a We've had a strangle market. I mean he hasn't really gone anywhere. So 120 90 is a one standard deviation Fine with this you can also with the stock at around a hundred so you're you're $20 if you have 17 Excuse me 16 dollars away to the upside and you're only 14 Dollars away for the downside pretty much straight on you can go down to 85 go down to 85 just see what happens You're in the weekly options go to please go to 39 days. Thank you Okay, so your dollar 76 let's go down to the 80 85s Are you at a buck 30 what do we like to get on a strangle at least a dollar okay? So it's your decision 120 call 85 put or 120 call 90 put you do it when the show's over Okay, all right, let's take a quick moment here just to recap what we talked about and really all that we Talked about today was recapping going over your portfolio if you've been away from your portfolio for a week Go through everything. Did you like the pressure that you had on meaning did you did you Did your portfolio do well through the market if it didn't maybe you take away some of those deltas which you didn't see an X Did you like an iron kind of the add on a teal tea maybe not maybe we a role to extend some duration Makes sense. Yeah, all right good job at you today and welcome home and your account likes you being home too I know it's good to be back. That was the first thing I told you I was like I missed this who comes up next Tim night peace

I did what's the vacation feel like? Um, it was great. I mean great great. Hold on a second. It was great. It's great. Your vacation was great It's up first let's take a look at your account for me My account was not great. That was not great. Everything I do revolves around how may account it Let's take a look at your account how do you account do this last week? Not good. It was better today, but It's better today today you're up around 350 bucks, but you lost about 450 $500 total on your overall account you went from up around a hundred dollars 50 bucks to 100 bucks depending on how things were marked and now you're down 50 dollars today But you but today's P&L is nice it up 350 bucks. Yeah, it's it's net your down 50 dollars on everything that you close Everything else. Yeah, alright, so I want to do like some portfolio review on because that's how we left Last week when when you left going over everything saying hey, you know We like everything that we saw let's go over what we still have and see if our opinion hasn't changed on that Okay, let's just click on Apple So Apple you have basically a strangle with the stock right at 120 Right in between it's right in between so that's what you want right so you don't see that's an easy decision to make Yeah, right because Apple's rally four dollars today And you actually have a profit in there of around $65 on the overall trade that you put in so you're gonna close that actually Pretty soon you want to make about 50% of your possible profit. Let's get out of that next one CNX Okay, um, it's one of my dogs. It's one of your dogs you're down about a hundred dollars on the trade So I was almost gonna say like a silly $15 stock, but as you can see any stock whether it's a you know a hundred dollar stock hundred and twenty dollar stock like Apple or a fifteen dollar stock like CNX they all these options can grow teeth Yeah, so you have to be careful them. Okay, so What do you want to do here? So you long about 60 shares of stock at 60 delta's 58 dollars 58 delta's you know when I looked at it It still got a really high IVR and it you know the one thing that I was thinking was like is there anything That we can continue you know sell in there to kind of Help the position at all.

Let's go into let's go to the trade page and go to CNX You've got a 92% IV rank totally fits you're lucky that you still have 39 days left to September So you're kind of in that same type of time frame that we would open a trade so you have a lot more For lack of a better word you have a lot more options to do like you have a lot more things to do if this was 11 days to go It's like it's closer role, you know like you can't sell anything because you know the option to be trading for 20 cents 10 cents or We're nothing even make sense. Yeah, okay, so let's look at what we can do So the first thing I would look to do is well what's the first thing you would look to like what's called you want to do?

So it just it just is is that acceptable number for you Well, let's move what are we at it? So you're okay, that's good. That's perfect just to compare So 76% Well the delta here I can do it here hold on one second. So what I want to look at is like what's the delta on that option? So the delta on the 16 option is 30 I'm just rounding you had 60 you'd be cutting your delta in half We like to cut out delta by one third to one half Okay, so that's in that I mean that would fit the only thing that I would say to you at this point with 39 days to go and you Certainly could is if you go below 15 you start getting inverted Meaning that your put is gonna be In the money and your call is gonna start to be in the money if the stock were to rally So with 39 days to go I would love for you to be above 15 So if you were to tell me any option above 15 I'd be happy with it the 15 call has a 40 delta You had about 57 delta so you'd be taking on a little bit more than 50% about 70% of your delta. What do you want to do? Well if I take on more that premium with the with the 16 Wouldn't that give me more opportunity like if you know, let's say that if cnx goes up by 10 or 15 cents tomorrow 10 or 15 cents not gonna make a difference gonna be a perfect play Yeah, wouldn't I be able to like kind of almost scratch out of it? With you play for scratch No, but I mean it's delta risk I love I love what you're working through it. It's delta risk versus premium received But let's think about what we would what happens if we add this trade. There's no extra buying power We're getting rid of some delta risk. So if you don't like the delta risk in cnx 60 delta You can reduce it by about two thirds 42 delta's 40 delta's minus the 60 delta's that you have about a little more than half that's the that's the play It's the 16 or the 17 call Personally, I like the 16 call just for the 50 cents versus the 30 cents Okay, let's do that then let's go So let's go in the bit is 53 the offers 57. Let's go in at 56 and see what happens. Okay, you can always change it later on Okay So now all around the world your tiny little one lot the smallest you can get is gonna change the market For all eternity gonna make this market 53 56 that's your offer No, that's really that's your offer now like you're you're changing Wall Street with your option your trade It's pretty impressive. Let's go back to your trade page running out of time ready. Okay, GLD That one's finally moved into into your range. Yeah, it's my right. So you don't think there's anything to do. No sounds good to me any That one was in my range too, but it's The price I got it. I was like 1760 something so because it's a covered call. It's a cover call Right that's showing there on Doza covered call with the stock. Yeah, so you're down about 20 bucks on this trade Yeah, so we'll sit okay, okay, let's go in the Netflix Netflix we've moved outside your range you're down around 150 or 160 bucks on the trade defined risk trade You want the stock to go down about four five dollars? Mm-hmm. I don't know. I think you sit. Yeah, so sound good to you Yeah, I mean this is close right and I don't want to close it for a loss So we'll say you only have 11 days left to that Netflix trades Okay, SPY that's your short delta trade This is the probably the only one that in hindsight which is such a terrible word You could have closed because this is a bearish position. Yeah, you are up around $70 on the trade half would have been about a hundred bucks So you can't kill yourself about that. I mean you might not have kept the other positions you had on if you didn't have this one on That makes sense. Mm-hmm. Let's get out of SPY TLT dog dog Okay, so your your your put spread is basically worthless, right? I mean it's two cents That was the one I wanted to put on originally you want to sell put spread correct you down about $70 on the iron condor Yeah, what can you do if anything here? Well, it's to find risk so we're not so you don't have to do anything. Yeah, mm-hmm May I guess you could Get rid of the the puts I mean like so so that's our worthless So you could buy back you could buy back your naked put and that wouldn't free up any buying power because you're not You don't get relief you have relief on both sides So so you only getting you only have margin on one side So you would be you'd still have one side on okay? So you take off the put for two cents pay no commission for that because if you just put the naked option for under a nickel There's no commission so that's something you could do But then that just leaves you with a call spread that's right at the money what you could do is you could roll the call spread To the following month September and if you could do that for even or a small credit That might be something you'd want to do Okay, so all you're doing is this extending duration Okay, so giving a chance to go Give a chance for TLT below that's correct. Yeah, a little bit of credit It kind of gives us a little more wiggle room exactly not a lot of wiggle room But a little bit but it extends duration by 39 days because this is gonna be over in 11 days So let's when we're done when you're done with the show Let's look to roll the call spread just the call side and close the naked put okay? If you can't roll for a credit just leave it alone or even you're probably gonna have to probably probably a small debit Anyway, we'll take a new trade for you because you need new trades. We were behind. Let's go to win WH Sorry WYNN and I'm just gonna make it really simple because or really fast because we'll have about two minutes I don't want to eat Tim's time 57% IV rank In our range in our IV rank range 39 days to go to expiration still good. Let's just do a strangle a real wide one Let's go to strangle strangle seem to be a We've had a strangle market. I mean he hasn't really gone anywhere. So 120 90 is a one standard deviation Fine with this you can also with the stock at around a hundred so you're you're $20 if you have 17 Excuse me 16 dollars away to the upside and you're only 14 Dollars away for the downside pretty much straight on you can go down to 85 go down to 85 just see what happens You're in the weekly options go to please go to 39 days. Thank you Okay, so your dollar 76 let's go down to the 80 85s Are you at a buck 30 what do we like to get on a strangle at least a dollar okay? So it's your decision 120 call 85 put or 120 call 90 put you do it when the show's over Okay, all right, let's take a quick moment here just to recap what we talked about and really all that we Talked about today was recapping going over your portfolio if you've been away from your portfolio for a week Go through everything. Did you like the pressure that you had on meaning did you did you Did your portfolio do well through the market if it didn't maybe you take away some of those deltas which you didn't see an X Did you like an iron kind of the add on a teal tea maybe not maybe we a role to extend some duration Makes sense. Yeah, all right good job at you today and welcome home and your account likes you being home too I know it's good to be back. That was the first thing I told you I was like I missed this who comes up next Tim night peace

Transcript:  I'm not very good today, but I'm optimistic and I think that's what you should be and I'm optimistic too. I've noticed that there isn't, you don't always have to freak out about things, there's time and with the Costco trade I'm not worried, I think there are things that we can do and I'm not worried about the moves. Costco trade? With the Costco trade. That trade was going against us the entire time. You waited and we closed. We waited and we made adjustments and we closed it for a profit. I think of that in the same light here. Okay, all right. So with that in mind, a little bit different than what you said to me on the break. So with that in mind, what direction do you want to take the show today? I wanted to go into rolling in the same duration, kind of similar to what we did with Costco, but these stocks have kind of had dramatic moves in a short period of time since we placed the trade. So I wanted to see like, so what's trading talking about? So the two I was looking at were the Apple and the wind strangles that we did. Which one you want to go to first? Let's go to the wind first. Okay, that's gonna win. And so we put wind on yesterday. Yes, today. And this stock was like 105-ish. We have, or 104-ish, you know, we had $15 on each side was our strangling. And so the strangle for $1.72 pretty much equal distance away? Yes. And so, you know, today the stock's down 488 right now. And, you know, going with what we did with Costco, I'm looking at the call side and thinking to myself, well, I've hit 50% profit over one day. And the calls to buy it back is like, what, 40 cents right now? I sold it for 76. So, you know, just under 40% or 50%. Okay. And, you know, we're still outside of one standard deviation. So I was thinking that we would roll it down in the same month to the 115. Essentially taking that credit, you know, the 50% profit and adding, you know, and selling and taking in more premium kind of gives a little bit more wiggle room to my, you know, put side, my short put, while still staying, you know, outside the standard deviation move to the upside. Okay. So I let you talk because I thought, you know, I'd be able to pick up on some things that you got right and some things that you got, in my opinion, you got wrong. Because there's no real wrong answer in any trade that you make. The only way the answer is going to be validated as right or wrong is what the stock does in the future. Okay. So I'm going to give you some guidelines that we have. You just put this on yesterday. You went to a full standard deviation. 38 days away. This is not a weekly option. It's a monthly option. 38 days away. You now have the stock having a big move of $4, $5, $4.80. I understand the panic in your eyes. And I like that. I don't see it as panic. I see it as an opportunity. Okay. Fentata, change that to, um, uh, to option view. Just so we could see the delta on the overall trade. Uh, no, I apologize. Um, I know we are looking at win. Yeah. There you go. And go down to win. Okay. So let's look at the, I love your opinion. I love everything that you said. Let's look at what the numbers say. Your delta is 14 delta. That means you're long 14 shares of stock. You've had positions on that had two, three, four times that amount of delta. And you weren't worried about it. It's because it's a big move today. And it is a big move. And then when you put on a strategy like a strangle, you don't want a lot of movement. And when you get a lot of moving quick, it puts you behind the eight ball, so to speak, because you have a small loss in it. You're down 50 bucks on the, on the trade that you put on for a dollar, 72, 170. It's a big percentage move. Sometimes with 38 days to go, we just sit and we let the market be cyclical. The rule that we have, not really rule, the thing that we try to follow is when our, um, bike is breached. Remember CNX yesterday when we were trading it, your, your strike had already been breached. Meaning we had gone past there. The biggest mistake, and it's definitely a mistake that you may when you were talking about your overall trade and win is I have a 50% profit on the call. You can't, it's almost like when people say, like, you know, I'll listen to somebody when they're talking and they'll tell me, the market opened up, uh, down 50 points. Well, the market can't open up and down 50 points. The market opened down 50 points. Then I know you've traded before. Same thing with this. It's an overall position. If you're down 50 dollars on the position, like, I don't care if my left hand makes money or my right hand makes money. As long as together, I have a net net profit. You have a net net loss on this trade. You can see on the right hand side around 53 bucks or so. So it doesn't matter that the call lost 50%. We only cover the, the, the overall position for a profit when both sides equal at least a 50% profit. That means once I could be zero, the other side could be a full winner. Once I could be 25% winner. It's like a 25% winner. We close it all at one time. So if you wanted to move down the win trade, I have no problem with it because there's 38 days to go. I prefer to roll into strength or into weakness. Let me explain. Wins down four dollars today. I would want to roll from a place of strength, meaning if the trade was profitable or I wanted a role, if the stock is low, I wanted a role that puts closer and collect more premium. I don't want to like be chasing it all the time because you chase your, you know, you seem to chase your tail after not you. Yeah. It's just been my experience. Like, you know, take today away for a moment and let's go to Apple since it was the other one. So let's leave win the way it is for a moment. You have 14 long deltas. You can here, look at all the other deltas you have at any end, you got 64 deltas, Apple got 26 deltas, CNX got 41 deltas, you know, three, four times the amount of delta. worry about those because your delta is going to be your risk. Right now it's just volatility expanding and the market moving too fast for you. In Apple, you got 26 deltas. That's twice as much as win. So let's take a look at that since you're thinking about rolling. Okay. The Apple trade you put on, I think, what do we say on the fourth or so? On the third, I believe it was about 118, 19 area. The stock was, we gave ourselves like $10 on each set of believe. Okay. And now the stocks, 114. Now, it's down $5.60 today. Yesterday it was up $4.50. Had we rolled down the calls the day before because the stock had made such a big move while you were on vacation, we never get that move back up. I mean, today you're down, and this is the biggest one that you're down on, you're down $145, $146 on this trade today. That's a big concern to me than the $50 you're down and win. Does it make, like, I'm trying to, I'm trying to give you good, like, mechanics on what to look at. Yeah. Now, on the Apple trade, you still have high, high implied volatility. Well, it actually went up. When we went in, it was about, like, 41 or 42 in the 40 range. And so this was the one that I would, you know, was the other one that I was looking at about the rolling idea because the premium is even higher there because we have the higher IVR. Okay. And, you know, I was looking to take the same concept as the win one and to roll that down, you know, to the, I think it was $1.15. To the $1.15 stock is $1.14 a change. No, I'm sorry. The $1.25. Okay. We had $1.35. We went, yeah, we, so we had the $1.30 call and the $1.10 put. Okay. So for the sake, so for the sake of time, open up the Apple for a moment. So for the sake of time, you would want to roll down the $1.30 call to the $1.25 call. And it looks like you can do that spread for around $0.50. Like $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. You, you, you could, let's think about what it would do to your, to your deltas. You'd pick up about six or seven short deltas. You take your delta from around 26 to about 20 for $0.50. It's not, it's not bad. And you certainly could. I'd rather do it from a place of strength and do it when the stock is rallying. How about we have a little bit of a rule? We'll see how it goes. Yes. Or way of looking at it. We won't touch these until the strike is breached. Until then, we'll just kind of sit back. Sometimes doing nothing is the heart like, like, you can only control entry. Remember I told you about like, you know, the only thing you can control is, you know, your confidence and your entry. You only can control entry. We did this with high implied volatility. Maybe not the best. Maybe we were struggling to find a trade. So we went as far out as possible. Up until yesterday, this trade throughout all of this time was, was, was, was, was, a profitable trade. We had a chance to make, you know, 50 bucks out of a possible 150 bucks. We decided not to take that. Maybe that was our mistake and not looking to do something to enhance or adjust this trade. Now, I don't know what's going to happen to Apple tomorrow or the next day or a week from now. Maybe rolling down for the 50 cents might have been better. Personally, if I was going to roll this down, the 50 cents doesn't help me that much. I might think to roll this all the way down to the, to the 120's and do it for like a $1.70. Then I would basically be neutralizing my deltas by about, no, almost 20. I believe in myself only long about six or eight deltas. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like, you got to, I mean, if you got to do it, do it. Just doing a little bit doesn't help you very much. That makes sense. All right. So, so for these strangles, what we're going to do is we're going to do it for when I when I was, when I was strike is breached. Yeah. That's what our research shows. Okay. Okay. I mean, I didn't make this up. This is not, you know, my 30 years of trading. This is my 30 years of trading and our research. All right. So I'll sit tight. It stinks. But I'll sit tight. All right. So I wanted to talk to you about the oil sector for a moment. And if you go to, well, for the sake of time, let's go to just go to the trade page and go to OIH. Now, this is something that you brought up to me. And I kind of, I kind of liked the idea. And I didn't know that you wanted to talk about rolling the apple and the net and the wind trade that we just did. But you got OIH, high implied volatility is 67%. You want to go to chart of it for a quick second. Maybe you can even use toss if you want. That's great. If you look down at the bottom there, you've got that IV rank. And if you don't have this script, you can get it from our support team. Just email support at tastytrade.com or support at Doe. And they'll show you how to copy and paste this into toss. What else is shown is your IV rank percentile, 67%. Now we could argue that it's been 80 or 90% back in January. But this is the highest it's been in the long time. This is the oil sector. Okay. It's like the producers. It's not like actual oil. It's the, what do they call it? Services. There you go. Let's go into forward slash CL just for a quick moment. It's oil itself. And you can see it basically mirrors the same. So it is a play on oil. Oil is at lows. Uh, USO is a real small product going to USO. Also has a decent IV rank, but it's only like a $14 stock. So the option is only about 20, 30 cents, one strike out of the money. Not a lot there do. Oh, IH. Let's go to a trade page of there in Doe if you'll mind. Let's look at, we've done strangles. Let's look at a straddle. Now straddle is only going to use about $600 in buying power as opposed to the strangle in apple that used, you know, $15 or win that used $17 or $18. I don't remember the exact number. This only uses 600. So if your buying power reduction is one third of what it is in apple or win, it has to have one third less risk. Does that make sense? Yeah, I mean, like if you're risking less money, you're going to have like a less lower pop and then you can have a higher. Well, you're probably, the profit is going to be the same. Your return to the capital is going to be so much greater. It's going to be greater. So, so let's look at this. So what our research has shown that it was when the IV rank is high, like at 100, you should look at a straddle. I'm going to make the argument that this is the highest that's been this year. So let's look at a straddle in here. Cool. Okay. So into September, we're selling the 32 straddle that's OIH. Let's just tweak it a little bit. Let's move the put to just out of the money, $31.5, this half dollar wide strikes. And let's move the call. Well, let's leave the call right there at 32 since the stock is almost in the middle at 31.81. I'll go to 31. I'm sorry, go to 31 and 32. I'm sorry, they don't have half dollar wide strikes. I apologize. They will in 10 days. Okay. So we did the whole trade, the mid price is $2.38. On $600 worth of risk, we looked at close this at 25% of possible profit. So we wouldn't want to close this at a dollar 40 profit. We'd want to, excuse me, a dollar 20 profit. We'd want to close this at around 60. 70, 70, 70 profit. Makes sense? And let's go into $2.38. See if we get filled. If we don't get filled, you'll move it down by a penny or two. We'll go from there. Well, let's take a quick break on what we discussed today. We actually discussed two things. We discussed our criteria on when we should roll strangles, talked a little bit about patience, and then we went into the oil sector, OIH, found a high implied volatility, change our strategy just a little bit from a wide strangle to I would consider this a straddle, although it's not the exact same strikes. Yeah. It's one strike out of the money, but the stock's right in the middle. Makes sense? Yeah. Okay? I'm excited about it. All right, good. Let's make your account a little bit better tomorrow. Okay? Do something about that. Who comes up next? Tim Knight's next. Peace. Just move it down by a penny or two.

So let's take a look at that since you're thinking about rolling. Okay. So the Apple trade you put on I think what do we say on the fourth or so? On the third. On the third. It was about 118, 19 area. The stock was. The stock was about ourselves like $10 on each set of believe it. Okay. And now the stock is 114. Now it's down $5.60 today. Yesterday it was up $4.50. Had we rolled down the calls the day before because the stock had made such a big move while you were on vacation. We never get that move back up.

And you know I was looking to take the same concept as the win one and to roll that down to the I think it was $1.15. To the $1.15 stock is $1.14 a change. No I'm sorry the $1.25. Okay. We had $1.35. We went yeah we so we had the $1.30 call and the $1.10 put. Okay. So for the sake of time open up the Apple for a moment. So for the sake of time you would want to roll down the $1.30 call to the $1.25 call and it looks like you can do that spread for around $0.50. Like $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. $0.50. You could let's think about what it would do to your to your deltas. You'd pick up about six or seven short deltas. You take your delta from around 26 to about 20 for $0.50. It's not it's not bad and you certainly could. I'd rather do it from a place of strength and do it when the stock is rallying. How about we have a little bit of a rule we'll see how it goes or way of looking at it. We won't touch these until the strike is breached. Until then we'll just kind of sit back. Sometimes doing nothing is the heart like like you can only control entry. Remember I told you about like you know the only thing you control is you know your confidence and your entry. You only can control entry. We did this with high implied volatility maybe not the best. Maybe we were struggling to find a trade so we went as far out as possible up until yesterday this trade throughout all of this was a profitable trade. We had a chance to make you know 50 bucks out of a possible 150 bucks. We decided not to take that. Maybe that was our mistake and not looking to do something to enhance or adjust this trade. Now I don't know what's going to happen to Apple tomorrow or the next day or a week from now. I may be rolling down for the 50 cents might have been better. Personally if I was going to roll this down the 50 cents doesn't help me that much. I might think to roll this all the way down to the 120's and do it for like a dollar 70. Then I would basically be neutralizing my deltas by about almost 20. I believe in myself only long about 6 or 8 deltas. You know what I'm saying? Like you got to, I mean if you got to do it, just do it a little bit doesn't help you very much. That makes sense. So for these strangles what we're going to do is we're going to do it for when I've strike is breached. That's what our research shows. I didn't make this up. This is not my 30 years of trading. This is my 30 years of trading and our research. All right? So sit tight. It stinks. But sit tight. All right. So I wanted to talk to you about the oil sector for a moment. And if you go to, well for the sake of time, let's go to the trade page and go to OIH. Now this is something that you brought up to me and I kind of liked the idea and I didn't know that you wanted to talk about rolling the apple and the net and the wind trade that we just did. But you got OIH, high implied volatility is 67%. You want to go to chart of it for a quick second. Maybe you can even use toss if you want. That's great. If you look down at the bottom there, you've got that IV rank. And if you don't have this script, you can get it from our support team. Just email support at tastytrade.com or support Eddo. And they'll show you how to copy and paste this into toss. All this is shown is your IV rank percentile, 67%. Now we could argue that it's been 80 or 90% back in January. But this is the highest it's been in the long time. This is the oil sector. Okay. It's like the producers, it's not actual oil. It's the, what do they call it? Services. There you go. Let's go into forward slash CL just for a quick moment. It's oil itself. And you can see it basically mirrors the same. So it is a play on oil. Oil is at lows. Uh, USO is a real small product going to USO. Also has a decent IV rank, but it's only like a $14 stock. So the option is only about 20, 30 cents, one strike out of the money. Not a lot there to do. Oh, IH. Let's go to a trade page of there in Dove, you'll mind. Let's look at, we've done strangles. Let's look at a straddle. Now straddle is only going to use about $600 in buying power as opposed to the strangle in apple that used, you know, $15 or win that used $17 or $1800. I don't remember the exact number. This only uses 600. So if your buying power reduction is one third of what it is in apple or win, it has to have one third less risk. Does that make sense? Yeah, I mean, like if you're risking last money, you're going to have like a less lower pop and then... You're going to have a higher, well, you're probably, the profit is going to be the same. Your return to the capital is going to be so much greater. It's going to be greater. So, let's look at this. So what our research has shown that it was when the IV rank is high, like at 100, you should look at a straddle. I'm going to make the argument that this is the highest that's been this year. So let's look at a straddle in here. Cool. Okay. So into September, we're selling the 32 straddle that's OIH. Let's just tweak it a little bit. Let's move the put to just out of the money, $31.5, this half dollar wide strikes. And let's move the call... Well, let's leave the call right there at 32 since the stock is almost in the middle at $31.81. I'm sorry. Go to $31.32. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go to $31.32. I'm sorry. They don't have half dollar wide strikes. I apologize. They will in 10 days. Okay. So there's $2.38. On $600 worth of risk, we look to close this at 25% of possible profit. So we wouldn't want to close this at $1.40 profit. We'd want to, excuse me, $1.20 profit. We'd want to close this at around 60... 70... 70......send profit. Makes sense? 70 dollar profit. All right. Let's go into $2.38. See if we get filled. If we don't get filled, you'll move it down by a penny or two. We'll go from there. Now, let's take a quick break on what we discussed today. We actually discussed two things. We discussed our criteria on when we should roll strangles. Talked a little bit about patience. And then we went into the oil sector, OIH, found a high implied volatility, changed our strategy just a little bit from a wide strangle to I would consider this a straddle, although it's not the exact same strikes. Yeah. It's one strike out of the money, but the stock's right in the middle. Makes sense? Yeah. Okay? I'm excited about it. All right, good. Let's make your account a little bit better tomorrow. Okay? Do something about that. Who comes up next? Tim Knight's next. Peace. Just move it down by a penny or two.

Transcript:  Good day for me then. Good, good answer yeah you're about 108 thousand in your account overall for the day. down about that yesterday. So, net it's basically a wash for the last couple of days. Had some big movement in the market today. I mean, probably the biggest movement you've seen in your trading career so far. For sure. For sure. Okay, one thing I wanna talk about, let's put a chart up of Apple if you don't mind. Apple's had a lot of movement today. Stock traded under 110, that's under your short strike. We talked about it yesterday, how we would roll down the call. If it breached out of strike, it did. Stock has subsequently rallied back. And that's cost us about 60 bucks. But if you look at your Apple position right now, you're unchanged for the day. Now, you would have been up $60. Had we done nothing. Which is a substantial amount of money when you're down $1,15 or $120 on the overall trade. So, for this example, that roll down hurt us. You had high implied volatility. You had extreme price movement. You've gotta, you know, that's our rules. That's our guidelines to protect the position. Now we sit with it. Yeah. Makes sense? That's still in the middle of our strikes. You're short to 120, 115 call. And that's the only thing. No, 110. I'm sorry, one. One, 2110. One 10 put. Yeah, that put. One 10 put 120 call with a stock at 115. Okay. I don't wanna talk too much about the trades you have on. I wanna look at a new trade today. Okay. And I wanna look at, I wanna talk a little bit about like a stock substitution. Okay. So let's go to, let's go to city group for a minute. Let's go to trade page two. I wanna go to chart, that's fine. I'm sorry, you can do that however you wanna do it. Okay, so, stock's down about 3% over the last 10 days, 10 trading days or so. Had a bigger movement earlier today when I was looking at this. So it's kinda come back a little bit. It's not gonna hurt you so much on this trade and I'll explain to you why. Ivey rank of 51%, relatively high. It's been as high as 80% back in March or something like that, but relatively high, especially shortly after earnings. Last time it had earnings, Ivey rank never got above 25. Okay, so we got high implied volatility and not really low price, but not really high price either, right? I mean, it's kind of in the middle of its most recent range. All right, so I'll think about putting on a neutral trade, but using less buying power. Let me try to explain, let's go to a trade page on city group. So to buy 100 shares of city group, you'll need about $1,600 in buying power reduction for your account. That would be any type of margin account. Your account's no special than anybody else's that has a margin account. All right, so if I wanted to buy a covered call in here, which would be, well, what do you consider a covered call? Bullish, bearish, or neutral strategy? What, it depends on what you're, if you're doing like a short covered call, it would be a bullish strategy. There's only buying a covered call and selling a covered call. We buy covered calls to open and then we would sell a covered call to close. We're never going to sell a covered call to open. Does that make sense? Yeah. Buy a covered call that means you're buying stock selling the call. It's just called a covered call. So is a bullish bearish or neutral? Well, it's in a neutral position. You want it to stay in between. Covered call is buying stock, selling and at the money or just out of the money call. Typically sell the out of the money call or the call with around a 50 to 30 delta. So you have a small range below where the current stock price is, depending on how much credit you're getting for the call. You're complicating it too much. Bullish, bearish or neutral strategy? Neutral to bullish? Perfect. I'm buying 100 shares of stock. That's 100 delta's and I'm selling a call between 50 and 30 delta's. That's going to leave me anywhere between 50 and 70 long delta's. It's a bullish to neutral trade. If the stock doesn't move anywhere, I still make money because it's all a premium I sold on the call. But I really want the stock to fly. Yeah. We do that with new money. We do that with new money. We want the stock to go up into perpetuity because we have a limited amount of profit we can make. We'd like to make it tomorrow. It should go to 100. Does it make sense? Yeah. OK. $1,600 to buy 100 shares of stock. About $1,500 in change to buy 100 shares of stock and sell the nearest out of the money call, which has about a 46 delta. If you can circle it for me, it's a 57.5 call that would leave us long about 50 shares of stock. OK. My possible profit on the trade is the difference between the stock price, which was just rounded to 50 is 57. So I can buy the stock from 57 and it can go. I'm going to have to somebody has the contract to buy it from me at 57.5. So I can make 50 bucks. I'm selling the call. Let's just round up to $1,40. So I can make about $190 on the trade. Does that make sense? Yeah. Total. And I'm using $1,600 worth of buying power. OK. What if we instead of buying stock did a little bit of a stock substitute? Can you see the delta on the 50 call? Well, you know what? It says 100 right now, but it really should be more like 90. But let's just circle it. OK. So the 50 call has 100 delta. I'm going to argue that that's a little bit off. Because look at the put on the other side. It has a little bit of value. It also has a delta. It has to equal 100. So that call delta of around 90 gives me 90 shares of stock. For all intensive purposes, that's a stock substitute for me. It's going to move one to one with the stock. OK. Makes sense? Yeah. OK. So if I wanted to buy that option, I'd have to pay somewhere around parity for it. Do you know what parity is on that option? With the stock trading, let's just call it 57. It would be $7. Exactly. Exactly. Perfect. So I could buy that call for $7 if somebody was willing to sell it to me at parity. And I would have the same equivalent as buying 100 shares of stock. So instead of using $1,600, I'm only using $700. I could sell that same amount of the money call, $57.5 call, for $1.40. I'd only be buying a call spread. My risk would only be what I paid, $7, minus $1.40, or around $5.60. So I turned $1,600 worth of buying power into $5.60. Does that make sense so far? Because if you're taking the $1.40 off the top. Typical vertical spread, but like stock substitute. Because you're so deep in the money. Does that make sense? Yep. Okay. Your break even would be around $65.40. The difference between the price that you're paying for the spread and where the stock is. Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay. So far, we're good. You've done this before. Okay. Nobody's going to sell us that call at $7. They probably want more. Why? Because if it's only worth $7, why wouldn't somebody sell it to me at $701? Or $702 or $704? I mean, if you're lucky, but there's probably more extrinsic value than there, then that's just at $7.00 because there's time. Exactly. The put is worth something. So for me to get $100, I'd have to buy the call and sell the put. Does that make sense? Yeah. Because the $8 does there. So I could buy that call if I could for a parry would be around $7.00 and call it about 20 cents or something like that. Maybe a little bit less. Okay. Does that make sense? And then you get another 20 cents for the put side. Well, I'm not going to do anything like that because I want to buy just that call. And I'm going to give up that 20 cents or that 23 cents or that 22 cents to somebody else who's going to sell me that call and then go and sell that put. So that they do whatever they want with it. Does that make sense? Yeah. I mean, dilution. Yeah, I'm a little lost. Well, nobody's going to sell to you at parry, right? Yeah, because it's a scratch. I mean, no. Well, they have risk. Yeah, they. But then not to have risk, they have to see if I they sell you the call, they're now short 90 shares of stock. They have some risk. A lot of risk. Yeah, they've 10 shares of risk. Exactly. They have to do something against that. The way that they could cleanly do it would be to do something with that put. They would have to buy that put. They'd have to buy that put for 20, 21 or 22 cents. So they'd be locking in a 20 cent loss. Does that make sense? Yeah. So instead of doing that, they'd be willing to sell you that option probably $7.20. Yeah. So as opposed to having to sell that put. Excellent. That's correct. Now they're so now they're long, the free put. OK. At that's trading at around 20, 21 cents. OK. OK, I'm just trying to get you ahead on how to price an option. Because look at the market on that. $6.57. Why? It's wide. Makes sense? Yeah. OK, so what if we bought one call and the 50 call and sold two of the 57 and a half calls, what would our delta position be then? Almost at zero. I mean, it would be yes, exactly. I mean, it would show one, two, or five deltas or something. We're getting 46 there and then the 190 something on the long option so that it's canceling them out. Exactly. So on the covered call, let's back check. I'm trying to show you all the differences in the difference between all the different trades. OK. On the covered call, we had risk below our short price, the price we paid for it, which was around 55 and change on the stock. About $2 lower than we're at trading right now. OK, not bad, but we have risk all the way to zero. Here we have the same risk all the way to zero, but we're only paying $4.15, which means our break even is $54.15. OK. Does that make sense so far? Yes, because we're taking the premium, the difference in the two times amount of premium. But the same buying power of a covered call. So what's the what's the give up? The give up is I now have risk to the upside. Let's look at this on the on the on the other view. Our risk to the upside is above, it should be like $60, $60 and 60 cents or something like that. 60, $63. 60, $83. It depends on where the stock is and then what you pay for it. OK. So the covered call only has risk. It's a bullish to neutral position and it has risk only to one side, the downside. Here you have risk on two sides, but you're getting almost a third more in premium. Instead of $2 worth of premium, you're getting almost $3 worth of premium. OK. For the same buying power. And all you're doing is just getting is cutting off your upside. Well you have risk to the upside. You have a limited risk to the downside, because your call can only go to zero. You paid $4 and 15 cents for the whole thing. So you have $400 worth of risk to the downside. On the covered call, you have unlimited risk to the downside. Here you have unlimited risk to the upside. OK. So what kind of trade is this? It's a neutral strategy. A neutral strategy with upside risk. Makes sense? That's the trade that I want you to make. Cool. OK. All right. Let's take a quick review because we ran out of time. So what do we look at today? We looked at buying it in the money call option as like a stock substitute to use less buying power. We looked at just a vertical spread that would define our risk as a covered call would, define our profit as a covered call would, but also define our risk. We'd have no risk to the downside on the vertical spread. And we turned that vertical spread into a ratio spread one by two, but more as a stock substitution. So we're leaning neutral to slightly bullish, but we don't want it to go above its old high of around 60 dollars. Staying the same range, which is most of our positions. We want the stock to stay inside its range. Makes sense? Yeah. OK. Cool. And you get a third more premium for the trade. All right. Awesome. Tonight, what do I know my side? Peace. Peace to one.

Transcript:  You Thinking we're back when I start bat versus bat. How are you good? I've I've I've I got some relief today on some of my positions which which was a good a good day for me then good good answer Yeah, you're about $108 in your account overall for the day. We were down about that yesterday. So, net it's basically a wash for the last couple of days. Had some big movement in the market today. I mean, probably the biggest movement you've seen in your trading career so far. For sure. For sure. One thing I want to talk about, let's put a chart up of Apple if you don't mind. Apple's had a lot of movement today. Stock traded under 110. That's under your short strike. We talked about it yesterday. How we would roll down the call if it breached our strike. It did the stock. It subsequently rallied back. And that's cost us about 60 bucks. But if you look at your Apple position right now, you're unchanged for the day. Now, you would have been up $60. Had we done nothing. Which is a substantial amount of money when you're down $115 or $120 on the overall trade. So, for this example, that roll down hurt us. Yet high implied volatility. You had extreme price movement. You've got to, you know, that's our rules. That's our guidelines to protect the position. Now we sit with it. Yeah. Makes sense? That's still in the middle of our strikes. You're short to $12115 call. And that's the only thing. No, 110. I'm sorry, one. $12110. $110 put. Yeah, that put. $110 put. $120 call with the stock at $115. OK. I don't want to talk too much about the trades you have on. I want to look at a new trade today. OK. And I want to look at, I want to talk a little bit about like a stock substitution. OK. So let's go to a city group for a minute. And let's go to a trade page. I go to chart. That's fine. I'm sorry. You can do it however you want to do it. OK. So, stock's down about 3% over the last 10 days. 10 trading days or so. I had a bigger movement earlier today when I was looking at this. So it's kind of come back a little bit. It's not going to hurt you so much on this trade. And I'll explain to you why. Ivey rank of 51%, relatively high. It's been as high as 80% back in March or something like that. But relatively high, especially shortly after earnings. Last time, it had earnings. Ivey rank never got above 25. OK. So we've got high implied volatility. And not really low price, but not really high price either. I mean, it's kind of in the middle of its most recent range. All right. So I'll think about putting on a neutral trade, but using less buying power. Let me try to explain. Let's go to a trade page on city group. So to buy 100 shares of city group, you'll need about $1,600 in buying power reduction for your account. That would be any type of margin account. Your account's no special than anybody else's that has a margin account. All right. So if I wanted to buy a covered call in here, which would be, well, what do you consider a covered call? Bullish, bearish, or neutral strategy? What it depends on what you're, if you're doing like a short covered call, would be a bullish strategy. There's only buying a covered call and selling a covered call. We buy covered calls to open, and then we would sell a covered call to close. We're never going to sell a covered call to open. Does that make sense? Yeah. Buy a covered call that means you're buying stock selling the call. It's just called a covered call. So is a bullish bearish or neutral? Well, it's a neutral position you want to stay in between. Covered call is buying stock, selling, and at the money, or just out of the money call. Typically, we sell the out of the money call, or the call with around 50 to 30 delta. So you have a small range below where the current stock price is, depending on how much credit you're getting for the call. Complicated too much. Bullish, bearish, or neutral strategy? Neutral to bullish? Perfect. I'm buying 100 shares of stock. That's 100 delta's. And I'm selling a call between 50 and 30 delta's. That's going to leave me anywhere between 50 and 70 long delta's. It's a bullish to neutral trade. If the stock doesn't move anywhere, I still make money, because the premium I sold on the call. But I really want the stock to fly. Yeah. We do that with new money. We do that with new money. We want the stock to go up into perpetuity, because we have a limited amount of profit we can make. We'd like to make it tomorrow. It should go to 100. Does it make sense? Yeah. OK. $1,600 to buy 100 shares of stock. About $1,500 in change to buy 100 shares of stock and sell the nearest out of the money call, which has about a $46 delta. If you can circle it for me, it's a $57.5 call. That would leave us long about 50 shares of stock. OK. My possible profit on the trade is the difference between the stock price, which let's just round it to $57. So I can buy the stock from $57. And it can go. I'm going to have to, somebody has the contract to buy it for me at $57.5. So I can make $50. I'm selling the call. Let's just round up to $1.40. So I can make about $190 on the trade. Does that make sense? Yeah. Total. Yes. And I'm using $1,600 worth of buying power. OK. What if we instead of buying stock did a little bit of a stock substitute? Can you see the delta on the 50 call? Well, it says 100 right now, but it really should be more like 90. But let's just circle it. OK. So the 50 call has 100 delta. I'm going to argue that that's a little bit off, because look at the put on the other side. It has a little bit of value. It also has a delta. It has to equal 100. So that call delta of around 90 gives me 90 shares of stock. For all intensive purposes, that's a stock substitute for me. It's going to move one to one with the stock. OK. Makes sense? Yeah, because you're close to one delta, which is 100 shares. OK. So if I wanted to buy that option, I'd have to pay somewhere around parity for it. Do you know what parity is on that option? With the stock trading, let's just call it $57. It would be $7. Exactly. Perfect. So I could buy that call for $7 if somebody was willing to sell it to me at parity. And I would have the same equivalent as buying 100 shares of stock. So instead of using 1,600 bucks, I'm only using $700. I could sell that same out of the money call, $57.5 call, for $1.40. I'd only be buying a call spread. My risk would only be what I paid, $7, minus the $1.40, or around $5.60. So I turned $1600 worth of buying power into $5.60. Does that make sense so far? Because if you're taking the $1.40 off the top. Typical vertical spread, but like stock substitute, because you're so deep in the money. Does that make sense? Yeah. OK. Your break even would be around $65.40. The difference between the price that you're paying for the spread and where the stock is. Does that make sense? Yeah. OK. So so far we're good. You've done this before. And OK. Nobody's going to sell us that call at $7. They probably want more. Why? Because if it's only worth $7, why wouldn't someone sell to me at $701 or $702 or $704? I mean, if you're lucky, but there's probably more extrinsic value than that's just at $7. Because there's time. Exactly. The put is worth something. So for me to get 100 delta's, I'd have to buy the call and sell the put. Does that make sense? Yeah. Because you're the 8 delta's there. And then so I could buy that call if I could for a parry would be around $7. And yeah, I call it about $0.20 or something like that. Maybe a little bit less. OK. Does that make sense? And then you get another $0.20 for the put side. Well, I'm not going to do anything because I want it. I want to buy just that call. And I'm going to give up that $0.20 or that $0.23 or that $0.22 to somebody else who's going to sell me that call and then go and sell that put. So they do whatever they want with it. Does that make sense? Yeah. I mean, dilution? Yeah, I'm a little lost. Well, nobody's going to sell to you at parry, right? Yeah, because it's a scratch. I mean, no. No, they have risk. Yeah, they. So then not to have risk, they have to see if I, they sell you the call, they're now short 90 shares of stock. They have some risk. A lot of risk. Yeah, they have 10 shares of risk. Exactly. So they've got to do something against that. The way that they could cleanly do it would be to do something with that put. They would have to buy that put. They'd have to buy that put for $0.20, $0.21 or $0.22. So they'd be locking in a $0.20 loss. Does that make sense? Yeah. So instead of doing that, they'd be willing to sell you that option, probably $0.7.20. Yeah. So as opposed to having to sell that put. Excellent. That's correct. So now they're long, the free put. OK. That's trading at around $0.21. OK. OK, I'm just trying to get you ahead on how to price an option. Because look at the market on that. $6.50, $0.30. It's wide. Makes sense? Yeah. OK. So what if we bought one call and the 50 call and sold two of the 57 and a half calls? What would our delta position be then? Almost at 0. I mean, it would be yes, exactly. I mean, it would show 1, 2, or 5, delta's or something. We're getting 46 there. And then the 190 something on the long option so that it's canceling them out. Exactly. So on the covered call, let's back check. I'm trying to show you all the differences and the difference between all the different trades. OK. On the covered call, we had risk below our short price, the price we paid for it, which was around $55 and change on the stock. About $2 lower than we're at trading right now. OK. Not bad, but we have risk all the way to 0. Here, we have the same risk all the way to 0, but we're only paying $4 and 15 cents, which means our break even is $54, 15. OK. Does that make sense so far? Yeah, because we're taking the premium, the difference in the amount of premium, for the same buying power of a covered call. So what's the give up? The give up is I now have risk to the upside. Let's look at this on the other view. Reveals. Our risk to the upside should be $60, $60 and $60 or something like that. OK. $60, $60, $80, $3. $60, $3. It depends on where the stock is and then what you pay for it. OK. So the covered call only has risk. It's a bullish to neutral position. And it has risk only to one side, the downside. Here you have risk on two sides, but you're getting almost a third more in premium. Instead of $2 worth of premium, you're getting almost $3 worth of premium. OK. For the same buying power. Yeah. All you're doing is just cutting off your upside. Well, you have risk to the upside. You have a limited risk to the downside, because your call can only go to 0. You paid $4 and 15 cents for the whole thing. So you have $400 worth of risk to the downside. On the covered call, you have unlimited risk to the downside. Here you have unlimited risk to the upside. OK. So what kind of trade is this? It's a neutral strategy. Neutral strategy with upside risk. Makes sense? That's the trade that I want you to make. Cool. OK? Yep. All right. Let's take a quick review, because we ran out of time. So what do we look at today? We looked at buying it in the money call option as like a stock substitute to use less buying power. We looked at just a vertical spread that would define our risk as a covered call wood, define our profit as a covered call wood, but also define our risk. We'd have no risk to the downside on the vertical spread. Then we turned that vertical spread into a ratio spread one by two, but more as a stock substitution. So we're leaning neutral to slightly bullish, but we don't want it to go above its old high of around $60. Staying the same range, which is most of our positions. We want the stock to stay inside its range. Makes sense? Yeah. OK, cool. And you get a third more premium for the trade. All right. Awesome. Who comes up next? Tonight. What do I normally say? Peace. Peace. No.

Transcript:  I'm here to play the song. Make it right back. Where do I start? Bat vs. bat. How are you? All right today. All right today. What does that mean? I'm hurting a little bit today. Netflix, that Netflix position, the butterfly that we have on is... Going past your short strike. You had a broken wing butterfly on, right? Yes. $5 wide call spread. You were long by a $10 wide call spread. The stock was actually below your long strike shortly after we put it on. And now it's had basically a extremely large move, a standard deviation or more, move to the upside. And now it's today with it being up $4. It has gone over your break even. So what do you do with that trade? Eight days to go. I don't know. I mean, how do we manage that? We have a defined on entry. We have a defined risk trade. Broken wing butterfly. You were looking to make about $2.50 to risk about $500, $250 versus $5, with about a 70% probability of not......with a 70% probability of risking $1, excuse me, risking $2 to make $1, with a 70% probability of success. And now the stock has gone further. You said the fine risk trade is really another thing. Up until... No, up until today, you were right at your break even. On a large one standard deviation move, stock happens to be up $4 today. It could easily have been down $4. Makes sense? Yeah. So we said... Okay. Good morning. Colt, 50 cent debit, so it was a 50% profit on it. Right. It was a iron condor. 103.103.103.105.105.108.109. So it was a $2.00 wide put spread by a $1.00 wide call spread. Mm-hmm. Stock was in the middle. We sold the $2.00 wide put spread and the $1.00 call spread for a total of $1.00. So we had no risk to the upside. Stocks in the middle of your short strikes, exactly what you wanted. Like you said, an iron condor, you want the stock to be in between your short strikes. We closed everything at around 50%. You had a 50% profit and you closed it. Like that. Very good. All right. So yesterday, when on the clothes, when we were done talking, we talked about synthetic stock yesterday. And on the clothes, they were like, well, I'll have to go over that again. And we never went over it. So I made a slide for you. It's not a test because the answers are going to be there for you, but I'd like to just go over with you. So you have it clear so everybody else has it clear. And then we can make move on to a new trade today, also using synthetic stock. Cool. So let's understand this so that we can move on to the next trade. All right. So the stock is at $57. We were talking about City Group yesterday, but it could be any stock. Just the stock is at $57. Let's think about the counter party for a minute. So you're the counter party. You're the other side, the person who's going to take the other side of your trade. Okay. So you sell, somebody else goes and then buy because you wanted to buy yesterday, the 50 call. So you sell the 50 call at $7.10. The delta on the screen was about 100. So it's definitely stock substitution. You sold a call. Are you long or short? For short. So you go in and buy 100 shares of stock at $57. Did you lock in a 10 cent profit? Did you lose 10 cents or there's no way to tell? I mean, it's too early to tell at this point. Why? Because if the stock moves the value of the short optional change. Where do you have risk on that trade? Because you're right, but I don't think you got it yet. You have risk to... You have risk to the downside. Perfect. You sold the call. You got your short, your bot stock. You're going to be even down to $50 actually. $59.90. You're going to start losing money. Yeah, because that's the 10 cents I got over the... Exactly. Intrinsic. Yeah. Ten cents over parity. You see, so you have it. You understand it. You got it. So you have no risk to the upside on that trade. Stock can go anywhere and you would lock in a 10 cent profit. Stock anywhere above $50 and you have a 10 cent profit. Okay, so the only way to tell, please go to the next slide. The only way to tell is what the put is trading. The $57 put is trading at 20 cents at that moment. Remember, it's trading between 20 and 23 cents. I just rounded to 20 cents. If you had to, if you were the other counter-party, you sold that call for $7.10. Your risk is below $50. That should actually say the $50 put. I apologize. We have changed that for me and the archives. The $50 put is trading for $0.20. So I've got to go out and buy that put for $0.20. I'm locking in a 10 cent loss. So the fair value for that call that we were trying to buy, yesterday, was $7.20. Now nobody's going to sell it to you at $7.20. But they might sell it to you at $7.21 or $22 or $23. Does that make sense? Yeah. Forgetting about any type of dividend or anything like that. That's just pure, like if you're looking at a wide market and you're trying to figure out what fair value of an option is, all you've got to do is take a look at the stock, the call price and the put price, add the two of them together, and you get the fair value of the option. It makes sense. All right, awesome. Fantastic. Somebody wrote me an email. So every time we say make sense, they would take a shot. They'll be drunk within seven minutes of the show. Yeah. They won't make it to the close. They won't make it to the close for sure. And that makes sense, right? Yeah, that makes sense. You're going to get them drunk. All right. So let's talk about, I want to go to a low stock. High implied volatility. Over a 10% down would move. We always look for a little bit of reversion to the mean and price and volatility on that type of move down in 10 days. Let's go to a chart of USO. Awesome. Stocks trading 1408 right now. That's my fault I should have had that for you. That's two mistakes I made. The slide, the 57-foot was my mistake. Nobody else's. And that doing that was my mistake, too, I apologize. Stocks trading 1408. It's down 12.5% over the last 10 days. It's certainly been getting killed. There's no doubt about that. 57% IV rank. IV rank's been as high as 100 in here about, you know, three, four, five months ago. But markets move, things change. I've got to take advantage of what I have right now. You've got low implied volatility basically everywhere. Here I have low price, high implied volatility. What type of strategy would you look at? I mean, if you wanted to sell premium. Selling premium. Selling premium. Selling premiums. Covered call, low stock, low price. Yes. Stock. Covered call is good. Naked put is okay also. I want to keep the whole theme of a synthetic stock. So let's take a look at something. Let's go into go. And at the money put, if I sell it, how much delta does it have? Zero. At the money put, if I remember the 50 call that you were buying yesterday in city group, that had 100 delta because it was deep in the money. Any, forget about what's up there on the screen. Any in the screen is right. But any option that's at the money has a 50 delta. Delta is just directional risk. It's a 50% chance it's going to be in the money. It's a 50% chance it's going to be out of the money. That's delta. Does that make sense? Yes. So every put that's at the money is going to have a 50 delta. Every call that's at the money is going to have a 50 delta. So let me ask you something about synthetic stock for a moment. You with me? Yep. If I buy a call, I'm long how many, if I buy an at the money call, I'm long how many delta's? 50. If I sell a put, am I long or short more delta's? You're short 50. So you'd be... If I sell a put, if you're... I'll do the other way. If I sell a put, is that a bullish or bearish strategy? Bullish. Okay. So if I sell a put, am I long or short delta's? You'd be long delta's. Fantastic. If I sell the at the money put, I'm long how many delta's? 50. If I buy the call, that's at the money. So you're long 50 there too. So you're long 100 together. Synthetic stock. Okay. Okay. Because it's essentially the same as buying the stock there. Same exact thing as the example that we used in city group. Just using a deep in the money option. For pricing purposes. Okay. So if I sold two puts that are at the money, I'd have approximately how many delta's? Long. Long or short. Long. Perfect. Synthetic stock. Long call, short put. Synthetic stock. Long in the money call. Synthetic stock. Two puts that are at the money. Synthetic stock. Got it? Yeah. Okay. So let's sell two at the money puts or just out of the money. The stock is 1407. We're going to sell the 14 puts. Technically speaking, it's out of the money. I'm going to call it right at the money. Just as close as you can get. Close you can get. Okay. Remember I told you on a low price stock. Covered call. Not using a lot of buying power. Mm-hmm. What if we sold a call too? So we bought, excuse me, we sold two puts. We have 100 delta's. And we sell a call. Depending on what call we sell. Let's sell the at the money call for a moment. How many delta's would we have now? Uh, 50. Exactly. Because we're losing 50 delta with the call. You're getting short 50 delta with the call. You're getting short 50. Yeah. But you're collecting premium. If we sold the at the money call, the 14 and a half call, or just out of the money, that's the 14 call. I always default to being just out of the money. I never want to sell anything that has any intrinsic value. Even if it's six or eight cents. That's just me. Okay. I always want to sell something that has no value. Why should I sell something that has value? I traded for around $1.91. Selling two puts. Buying one call. Excuse me. Selling one call. Your break evens on this. And we can do it on the curve if you want to. It'll just show it a little bit nicer. Okay. Your break even on this is above, well, it'll say it right there. 1641. And on the downside, you're going to have around 1310 or something like that. 1305. Yep. Okay. What does that risk graph look like to you? That red and green area? Strangle. Strangle. Iron condor. Yeah. It's a neutral strategy. Neutral, but we're taking a bullish. Small bullish. Small bullish stance, unlike a covered call that has no risk to the upside. This has some risk to the upside because options are dynamic. They're going to move, get more delta, lose more delta. But this has a theta decay component to it that's almost three times greater than just a covered call using approximately the same buying power somewhere between $5 and $700 depending on what call you use. You like this? Yeah. Okay. But it's time I can take in premium. I like that. Good. Well, let's go into $1 and see what happens. You're going to confirm and send and send. Let's go over what we talked about today for just a quick second. Really all we discussed here were different forms of synthetic stock. The way to look at the same product, the same trades, the same options, either use more or less buying power to have more or less defined risk, to have more or less theta decay all to your own liking. Does that make sense? And keeping in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Some nice size. And to keep it the same as essentially having those 100 shares of stock. There's a bit of the... You're always going to, if you're going to get more theta decay, you're giving up something else. On a covered call, you have no risk to the upside. On this one, you have risk above $16. Okay? Yeah. All right. Very good, son. Good job, buddy. Do you understand synthetic stock a little bit more or at least the conceptually... Like, you don't have to know the nuances of it. You just have to understand it conceptually. Because then you can look at anything. You'll always be able to have a stock position now, maybe a long stock. And you get to a point where your buying power reduction is too great. How can I get rid of this stock? Use less buying power, but still have the same bang for my buck. You'll know to go to a deep in the money call and you'll know exactly what to pay for that call because you can figure it out. It's really powerful stuff. You're only a couple of weeks into this. Yeah. Now if we can get your account positive, it would be... I know, right. I know, right. I have a good job out of you today. Even the S&P's up 75 cents. Let's hope they fall out of bed. We'll all do a little bit better. Good job, buddy. Who comes next? Tim Knight. What do I say? Okay. I'm also up for it. Good. Thanks, Coolie. In the future. Yeah. It's easy. Is there a high-あの room?

Transcript:  Thank you. Thank you. Back. Where do I start? That versus bat. How are you? Good. I'm a little unchanged from yesterday. So that's how you are. Yeah, how you're counting. Yeah. You're counting basically on Jay. My life is either up, down or unchanged now. So it's good. Yeah. It could be a lot worse, you know. It could be a lot worse. All right, so I've got a million things I want to talk about. But you came up to me and I was sitting on my desk earlier today saying, hey, I got a trade. You said it was in Monsanto. We've been in Monsanto before. Let's go to Doe. I want you to go over the trade that you want to do so I can get to what I want to do. By the way, just take a look at your count before you get to that. Is this? This is just your set. This is just your September positions. It's always a good idea to take a look at like, you know, what you have on going coming near expiration September and August. That was first expiration coming up next week. Exciting. It's a big day and making your bones. Yeah. This is the first expiration. Where the, where the, where the action is. We like to be rolling soon. You only have a few positions left in September. I mean, in August, and I'm actually going to talk about one of them. But cool. It's always good to, you can scroll up or down wherever you have them. Just so there you go. So you have all of your August positions are unclicked and your September positions are all clicked. And this is giving you a probably a profit on those September positions that you have on. Why don't you do this? Why don't you unclick them all and then just click September. And I can be done with this part of this little demonstration here. I'm sorry. Click August. I keep saying the wrong things. And all he did was click on the middle of August there. So there's your August position. So basically what's showing you is you're a little bit long a short delta in August. No, short, short delta in August because you're green. You're in the area there, want you to go down, plus you've got those parentheses. And you're a little more neutral to neutral in September. Okay. Make sense? Yeah. Okay, perfect. You had a trade to do that you want to do in Monsanto. Yeah. So I was looking at the 95 110 put string or a put in call for a strangle. So one standard deviation move. Looking at a dollar 14 credit right now uses up about 12 to $1,300 in buying powers. Very similar to the trade we put on that we that I closed about a week ago for 45, 46% profit that time. You know, something to add to the portfolio, I like it. I mean, it gives me a lot of wiggle room there. And then you know, it hits all our benchmarks 74 IVR, one standard deviation move, dollar and credit. Okay. So the most important thing you said there, does set it up to give you the one standard deviation move. So everybody can get that. You like the trade because it has a high implied volatility rank of 74% using $1,300 or everything you said there at one hour percent true. No earnings coming right to the head earnings a couple weeks ago. Yep. Okay. Hit confirm and send and send. It looks like mid price is 115 right now. Let's go into 115 or how about this? It's the end of the day or near the end of the day. Let's go down to 114 where it was just a moment ago. And we'll see if we get filled if we don't move it from there. Awesome. All right, good job. There's no wrong answer. Only time will tell whether the trade was good or not, but the setup fit. Plus you have a lot of money sitting on the sidelines about $24,000 of a $30,000 account sitting on the sidelines you're using about six grand of your buying power. So it's not a it's not a game. Got to get in the game. Okay. So I've got two things. Do you want to look at an existing position that we need to roll or do you want to look at an existing position that we're going to do something really cool with? I guess maybe I'm selling that one. Yeah. Or do you want to look at another opening position in the cues? Let's do some cool. Okay. Let's save it for last because that'll be my it'll be my it'll be my wrap up. Let's go to the cues for a quick second. And I don't have a lot of time to set this up if I have more time later on I will just go to the cues. I look to the cues I WM SPY and the diamonds. Of all of them, the cues have been kind of the strongest. I want to put on some short deltas. We've got a market that's a little bit higher today going into expiration week of next of next week that's that can typically be slightly stronger by our own research. Not quite as strong. Well, it's strong typically. Okay. So so I want to do a slightly short position but a neutral position. Okay. I want to do a wide iron condor. All right. I want to use some buying power not a lot. But let me just show you what I want to do. All right. So if we were to sell just a naked call in here, you can go to nine condor. It's fine. Go to just move the strikes all the way down to one 13 is my short call and one of three is my short put. Very good. And you can leave the you can make the one. Okay. Okay. Okay. And make that one 18. You can step right there. $5.00.00. Go back up to one 18. And make the put also $5.00.00. 98.00. It's trading for around one 14.00. Perfect. Okay. 65% probability of success. If you looked at your September position, if you remember what your probability of success was on your overall position a moment ago. 52.00. Yes. Exactly. So this will enhance your position. And we're a little bullish to in the September too is neutral to bullish. And this is a little more neutral to bearish kind of offsetting a little bit. 114 is the mid price. It only uses around 300. You can click confirm and say, yeah, or the other but uses $386 in buying power. Not a lot of money and buying power relative. It's simulating a short strangle so that if you were to IRA account or something like that, you're giving up about 30 or 40 cents about 30 or 40 cents. By buying those wings, one's about 20 cents. The other one's about a nickel, maybe 30 cents, 35 cents, something like that. But it makes it IRA- I think that cuts your buying power. Cut your buying power down from around 1,300 bucks, which is the same in Monsanto down to about 400 bucks. Why don't we go in at $1.14? It was just there $1.14. Looks like we're rallying a little bit. Like we said, it has a little bit of a short skew to it. Okay. Cool. Good trade, right? Well, I mean, trade trades in and you've got your Monsanto trade in. Good good. About seven minutes left. One more adjustment. Cool. Win. Yep. Go to a chart of it real quick. Win's down to... It's getting close to our short. It's getting close to your short strike, your short put, which is the 90 put, but it hasn't breached it yet. Remember in Apple, we were talking about how if it breaches the short strike, then maybe we'll... We'll adjust down, then that's what we did. We've very, very mechanical with it. I should have added a little bit more to that. If it breaches the strike or you're out of the money option, has little to no extrinsic value, go to his win position for a minute. If it has little to no extrinsic value, you can just click on it if you want to. Those 120 calls, they're trading for around 17 cents. You've put trading for $3.30. It's basically just a short put and win. I know the risk graph can be what it is. It's got a big dollar, it's got a 35 dealt in it. If 35 long dealt in it. If I wanted to be long win selling a naked put, high implied volatility, I leave it. That's basically what you have. Yes, you have a strangle, but it's really just a naked put. I think we have to roll down that call, because that call at 17 cents is giving you no help. Let's roll it down. If we were looking to roll it down, how much delta reduction would be looking to achieve? We're cutting it. It's a percentage. I remember we spoke about this. That's why I'm here. If you don't remember, don't worry. A third to a half. With 30 some days left to go, a third really works. Does that make sense? I don't want to say if that makes sense. I don't want you to go, I don't want you to go as, I want you to still have the directional risk. It hasn't had an uptick since we've put the trade on. Maybe we can buy ourselves an uptick by just rolling down a little bit. I wanted to do that less. You did, and it would have been better. You're right. You're right. It's the second time you said you're right today. Well, second time the market's proved you're right. No, but remember we're emailing about this. I know what you're talking about. If it's not on film, I need to keep record of these. I have emails. If it's not on film, I can't remember. You're short the 120 call. Let's go down to the 110. What does that give you about what is a credit to receive there? 35. So that's not going to be enough. It doesn't make sense. Yeah. I mean, to roll down for 35 cents, it doesn't... The 105 gets me a bar. Ah, the 105 gets you a buck, but you have to buy back your own call that you're short. About 83 cents, I believe. That's where you got to go. So you'd be short to 105, and you'd be short to 90. Still have a little bit of long delta. You're only reducing your delta by about a third. Okay? Okay. All right, let's go in mid price is 83 cents. Let's go in at 83 cents, and we'll see what happens. We can always roll it down. You don't move it down a penny or two. All right. Last one, and the one that I really wanted to talk to you about, let's go into his SPY position if you could. You've got a really unique trade on an SPY. In SPY, we bought a $4 wide put spread by a $2 wide put spread. So we bought a deeper in the money put spread, and sold a $2 wide put spread. That's why you have that risk to the upside. You paid a $1.17. Okay. You're long a $4 wide put spread, short a $2 wide put spread. Your risk is that long put spread. Does that make sense? Yeah. No risk to the downside. You can tell by the graph. If we sell that long put spread, you have on the 7, 9, 13. What synthetic put spread are you long for versus the 7, 9, short put spread? Which way would I need what I want this doc to go at that point? Are you talking about or where would my strikes? Well, the 7 and the 9 is where... You're short the 7, 9 put spread. You're long a $4 wide put spread. The 13, 9. Yeah. So I'm long overall. You're long a put spread, which makes you short. That's why you have no risk to the downside. What long put spread do you have? Where's all your risk? On the 9, 9, 13. Yes? Because I... Oh, which one I'm missing a long one long put on the 13? The 11 put is missing. You've got a... Oh, to make it like an iron condor. To make it into a butterfly. To make it, you have a $4 wide put spread by a $2 wide put spread. A classic butterfly is equal distance on each side. $1 by $1, $2, $2, $4, $4, $10, $10. You have a $4 wide by $2 wide. So you're long an embedded put spread. The embedded synthetic long put spread that you have is the 213 to 11 put spread. If you sold the 213 to 11 put spread for a $1,17, that's what you paid for this spread 25 days ago, whatever. You paid $1,17, right? If you sold just $2 worth of that spread for $1,17, how much risk would you have in this butterfly? Zero, I'd be down to zero. Exactly. And you'd have a $2 wide butterfly with a chance to make how much in a best-case scenario. That'd be $2. $2 on the short. You'd have a free shot. Well, you can sell the 1311 put spread for how much? Let's find out. And we just rallied, so it's going to be a little bit less. So the 1311 put spread. 213 to 11. We'll just move up to six put. The 213 to 11 put spread's trading for a $1,58 mid price. If you sold that for $1,57, go down to $1,57, you'd have an extra $0.40 on top of $1,40. You'd lock in a $0.40 profit. You'd have a free butterfly. You'd be owning that butterfly with a $2 shot with a $0.40 profit. That's a cool trade. Let's go down to $1,57 and sell the spread if we can. The market just rallied, but we'll see what happens. All right, let's take a quick second here just to review what we went through. And I know we went through a lot of trades, but I want to go into that butterfly, because I think it's really, really important. You have an 80 cent profit on that spread right now. You could close that spread and take an 80 cent profit. You still have another 70 cents to reach 50%. You still could make another dollar on top of that. Or you could take off all your risk, sell the and synthetic long put spread for more than you paid for the whole package, have a free butterfly on it. Anytime you can do something for free, plus make that $0.40. I think you got to do it. Cool. All right. Who comes up next? Jim Knight. Peace.

Which way would I need what I want this doc to go at that point? Are you talking about or where would my strikes? Well, the 7 and the 9 is where... You're short the 7, 9 put spread. You're long a $4 wide put spread. The 13, 9. Yeah. So I'm long overall. You're long a put spread, which makes you short. That's why you have no risk to the downside. What long put spread do you have? Where's all your risk? On the 9, 9, 13. Yes? Because I... Oh, which one I'm missing a long one long put on the 13? The 11 put is missing. You've got a... Oh, to make it like an iron condor. To make it into a butterfly. To make it, you have a $4 wide put spread by a $2 wide put spread. A classic butterfly is equal distance on each side. $1 by $1, $2, $2, $4, $4, $10, $10. You have a $4 wide by $2 wide. So you're long an embedded put spread. The embedded synthetic long put spread that you have is the 213 to 11 put spread.

You'd be owning that butterfly with a $2 shot with a $0.40 profit. That's a cool trade. Let's go down to $1,57 and sell the spread if we can. The market just rallied, but we'll see what happens. All right, let's take a quick second here just to review what we went through.

Transcript:  I'm not sure if you're going to be able to do this. I think I'm going to be back. When do I start? That versus that? How are you? Good. Good day for me today. Good day for you today, yeah. It's been good. I got some movement in my direction for Netflix and TLT, which we were talking about yesterday. I'm with Incy, and what happens, and they're both moving in my direction, so I got a couple bucks back at the moment on those. It's nice to get something to go your direction from changing. You're allowed. Definitely. You're allowed. You're counted down around 200 bucks since we've started this, about $210. You're up about $127 today. You've gotten back about a third or a little bit more of all your total losses, which is cool. Again, the point of the show is to learn strategies, but also to make money, too. We don't do anything here. We don't want to make money on, so we want to get in the plus column. Very typical for new traders to do exactly how you did. You started out gang busters. Every trade you made was a winner. You were up like 200 bucks. Took a vacation for a week. Came back. Had a swing of about dynamic and trade for a week or so. Had a swing around $500. You were down around $300, $400 at one time. Now your count's starting to come back a little bit more. Number of occurrences keep moving on. You mentioned a couple of things to me at the lunch table today. What did you want to talk about? Well, because with the expiration this week, a lot of my coincidentally losers, but they're my shorter positions in Netflix and TLT, SPY. SPY. I think those are the only three that we have left in the front window. Everything else is September. Yes. But that's most of my short side of the portfolio. My September expiration is generally long. Long to neutral. Long to neutral. Yes. I was looking to get short. The marketer. Get short. Okay. Let me try to wrap it up here for a minute. Your overall portfolio is short about 40 delta. You want to put up the overall account so people can play along and look at the numbers at home too. So your overall account is short about 40 SPY beta weighted delta. Do we have it up there? Yeah, do them all. Where's your beta weighted delta on that? Do we have to go to the other view? My fault. What does it say? It's neutral. Almost at zero. Almost at zero. Yeah. Okay. When I beta weighted it earlier, it looked like it was around 50 delta. When I have it at about 50, I'm 50 short on the August. And then close to 50 long on the September. So basically even swing around. Okay. And what you're saying is with your short delta that you have going away in three days, you're worried about what's going to happen to your delta in the back month. I'll be long 50 delta at the end of this week. Okay. So you bring a great thing up. Okay. Let's just click on your SPY position. Since we just beta weighted everything to SPY. And one of the three positions you have on in the front month is SPY. Let's take a look at that. Now it's just a classic butterfly. We don't have any risk to this trade. The risk that we have left in this trade is how much trading for right now. We took a profit of around 40 cents on a broken wing butterfly. And that's all our risk that we have now. Okay. So the risk reward on this looks great. But that graph is a little bit deceiving. It's $100 at its biggest peak. It's trading for it looks like around, see if we're with the closing trade is about 50 cents it looks like. The spread's trading for around half of its possible profit. It's giving you some short deltas in the front month, which you will lose as soon as expiration goes off, which is in three days, or this position moves away. Makes sense? Okay. So why don't we close that position? Take the profit. It's win-win. Yeah. Great trade. And turn it into a different position in September that will give you some short deltas there. Cool. And we'll leave the Netflix trade on and we'll leave the TLT trade on. All right. So this one will be around $90 total. Profit on the overall trade that you put on that's correct. You made about 40 cents before and whatever this is trading for 50 cents or something like that, or pretty close to it. Oh, let's go into 50 cents and see what happens. We can always change it later on. Now you do want the stock to be at 209 at expiration. The stock is 209 81, but that's at Friday, not today. Yeah. Okay. So did we get filled on that? Did not get filled on that? Okay. So why don't we cancel and replace it and go down a penny and while he's doing that for us, what he's going to do is click on SPY, edit order, go down to 49 cents. We'll see if we get filled. And if we have to move it again, after the show is over, we'll move it again. Okay. Cool. I want to look at a ratio spread. Let's talk about your positions for a minute. Are they an alphabetical? Put them in alphabetical order for me. You can go to the option only view if you want. I'm sorry. The view all if you want. Okay. So in Apple, you have a strangle. I just want you to listen to what I say. Let's take a look at the results of strangle. CNX is a strangle. F-C-X is a strangle. MON is a strangle. NEM is a covered call, which is synthetic short put. I want to get into synthetics. Netflix is a synthetic. It's a butterfly, brokowing butterfly, but it's a synthetic short call spread. O-I-H is a strangle. The Q's you have an iron condor on. SPY you have a butterfly on that we're looking to close. TLT you have an iron condor on, which is really just a short call spread right now, because it's right at the money or just in the money. You're short the 121-124 with a stock at 123 and a half. And then in Twitter you have a short put, long position. You have a synthetic stock position, short two puts, short one call, and in win you have a strangle. So the word that popped out there a lot was a strangle. So I don't want to do anything that involves around a strangle. You're also using around $9,000 of a $30,000 portfolio. So I got to keep that in the back of my mind too. One third of your buying power is not a lot to be using, especially with IV rank being as low as it is, I think it's pretty active actually. If IV rank was high, I'd want you to be 50% closer to 80% on a $30,000 portfolio. So SPY is a big product. By big product I mean it's trading over $200, right? Yeah. So let's go into SPY. So a naked option in SPY would take around $4,000. Now of all the positions that you have on, you're only using $9,000. All of those strangles. You're only using $9,000 of your overall portfolio. So I want to keep things consistent. What I'd like to do when we're looking at a ratio spread is we like to keep a ratio spread is buying one selling two. A ratio spread can be any, it could be buying four selling five. It could be buying two selling three. We don't like to get any more than one by two. We will on occasion go one by three if volatility is really high, but we like one by two and we like to do it for a credit. We typically like to buy the option that's maybe one strike in the money, two strikes in the money, and sell an option that's one strike out of the money or two strikes out of the money. With that in mind, let's go into September and let's look at SPY 31 days to go. You can do a vertical spread and change it if you'd like. We're going to a long call and we'll actually go $3.00 is perfect. Move those strikes down so that my buy is in the money. $109. Change it. Make it $9.11. Make it $2 wide. Double click on the $11 call and make it two contracts. If I buy one of the $109 calls, I sell two of the $11 calls. I'm getting about a dollar in credit. Now that dollar is not as significant as when we look at a strangle and I tell you we like to collect a dollar, it just happens to be a coincidence here. I want to collect a credit because then I have no risk to one side. I have no risk to the downside. If I have no risk to the downside here, this has to benefit from a short movement or a down movement in the overall market, which is exactly what you are looking to do with your position. This is in September, which gives you some short deltas in September. This is a synthetic short call. That's what it works out to be. Now you break even on this, if you click on the little dollar amount, it's going to be just above your short strike plus the width of the strikes, meaning $109.11. That's $2, right? Plus the credit you received, it switched to $0.99. It was $1 before. It gives you a break even of $2.14. That break even of $2.14 has about a $67. That's just called it 70% probability of success. It also relies on volatility down ticking. Now, volatility is not high in SPY right now. It's 21%. But we're trying to get synthetic short deltas. We're trying to get short deltas in your overall portfolio. We're replacing one with the other. Let's go into a chart of SPY just quickly. Now I'm not going to make a great case here. I'm not going to argue, and you certainly could argue that the IV rank is not high enough in here. At a 20% implied volatility was actually a little bit higher before. At a 20% implied volatility, it's been as high as 60 over the last five months. I'm throwing out the first month there, and it's been as low as 0. It's still on the low end of the range, but I need short deltas. I need something. We're tweaking it a little bit. I'm buying a call spread, which is something you would do in a low implied volatility. I'm selling another call not to finance it because I need short deltas. Does that make sense? You certainly could just sell a call, but I don't think the IV rank warrants it. So we'll be close to 50 delta short on this, right? Because we're the two at the money calls. It'll be less. They're not at the money. Stocks 109. Sorry, 209, and you're selling the two at 11. Oh, 219, okay. So it only gives you about 10, 12 short deltas, not as much as you think. They will grow as the stock moves higher. What's the best price for this? Where do you want the stock to be at expiration? In between? No, I'll give you a hint. Typically all the strategies that we do, you want the stock to be right at your short strike. 211. Think about it. The 209 call, if this was expiration 31 days from now is going to be worth how much? It's going to have no extrinsic value. It's going to be parity. How much would it be worth? Nothing. No, the 209 call. Stocks at 211. If it goes to 211? Yes. It'd be worth $2. Exactly. You're selling this. What would the 211 calls be worth if the stock was 211? Nothing. Zero. So the one you own is worth $2. The calls you short are nothing. You got a dollar premium, and credit in this, you make $3 on a $2 move. Yeah, if it goes to 211, because then I can sell the long position for the $2. So it's a short position because you have no risk to the downside, but you really want 211. It's not an iron condo, but it's kind of like, you know, it's okay if it goes higher or just not too high. And you're breaking even all the way up to 214. Okay. That's going to use around $4,000 in buying power. That's too much buying power. Let's define our risk. But it's really not defining your risk. It's going to lower our buying power significantly. Now, you know, if you had a million dollar account, maybe you do this trade because $4,000 doesn't matter to you. If you did 10 contracts, $40,000 in buying power doesn't matter to you. But you can only control what you have, and that's how much money you have. So let's buy and add the money call. Let's look to buy like the 219 call. Make it like a broken-wing butterfly. Exactly. It's a broken-wing butterfly. I mean, like we start out, I just, so if you can break down all these positions, like we just started out as a ratio spread. You said, well, that makes it a broken-wing butterfly. Yeah, it does make it a broken-wing butterfly. Not in the classic sense, because it's $8 wide by $2 wide. But yes, it's a broken-wing butterfly. It doesn't change your probably success, you know, by more than a percentage point or two. It does take away some of your credit, but you get to save $3,500 in buying power to use some place else. And that's more important. That's a lot more powerful for increasing your return on capital by doing that. Let's put this in $0.87 is the mid price. Let's leave it there right at $0.88. It could firm and send it send. And when you get filled on one, we'll move the other one. If you don't get filled on the other one, we'll move them both. Make sense? Cool. Yeah. All right, let's just take a quick second here to recap on what we talked about. We talked about looking at your overall portfolio and where your deltas are. Meaning, are they in August or they September? We talked about it yesterday, how your short deltas mostly in August, your long adelta was mostly in September. So what we tried to do today with the ratio spread is take off some of that short delta in August and replace it with short delta in September. Okay? Yeah. Okay, cool. You all right? Yeah. All right, good for you. And you had a nice winner on a broker-wing butterfly of $90. Yeah. That's a lot. Yeah. On a small $2 wide, broker-wing butterfly. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. Normally say, peace. Peace.

Transcript:  I'm going to be back. I think I'm back. When do I start? That versus that? How are you? Good. Good day for me today. Good day for you today. Yeah. It's been good. I got some movement in my direction for Netflix and TLT, which we were talking about yesterday, you know, kind of just sticking with it and seeing what happens. They're both moving in my direction, so I got a couple bucks back at the moment on those. It's nice to get something go your direction from changing. You're allowed. Yeah, definitely. You're allowed. You're counted down around 200 bucks since we've started this about $210. You're up about $127 today. Yeah. You've gotten back about a third or a little bit more of all your total losses, which is cool. I mean, again, the point of the show is to learn strategies, but also to make money too. I mean, we don't do anything here. We don't want to make money on. So we want to get in the plus column. Very typical for new traders to do exactly how you did. You started out gangbusters. Every trade you made was a winner. You were up like 200 bucks. Took a vacation for a week. Came back. Had a swing of about dynamic and he trades for a week or so. Had a swing of around 500 bucks. You were down around $300, $400 at one time. Now, your count's starting to come back a little bit more. Number of occurrences keep moving on. You mentioned a couple of things to me at the lunch table today. What did you want to talk about? Well, because with the expiration this week, a lot of my coincidentally losers, but they're my shorter positions in Netflix and TLT, SPY. SPY? There are a lot of them. I think those are the only three that we have left in the front window. Yeah. Number. Yes. But that's most of my short side of the portfolio. My September expiration is generally long. Long to neutral. Long to neutral. I was looking to get short. The marketer. Get short. Okay. Let me try to wrap it up here for a minute. Your overall portfolio is short about 40 delta. You want to put up the overall account so people can play along and look at the numbers at home too. So your overall account is short about 40 SPY beta weighted deltas. Do we have it up there? Yeah, do them all. Where's your beta weighted delta on that? Do we have to go to the other view? It's wonderful. What does it say? It's neutral, almost at zero. Almost at zero. Yeah. Okay. When I beta weighted it earlier, it looked like it was around 50 delta. I have it at about 50 short on the August expiration and then close to 50 long on the September. So basically even G1. And what you're saying is with your short delta that you have going away in three days, you're worried about what's going to happen to your deltas in the back month. I'll be long 50 delta at the end of this week. Okay. So you bring a great thing up. Okay. Let's just click on your SPY position. Since we just beta weighted everything to SPY and one of the three positions you have on in the front month is SPY. Let's take a look at that. Here's the classic butterfly. We don't have any risk to this trade. The risk that we have left in this trade is how much trading for right now. We took a profit of around 40 cents on a broken wing butterfly and that's all our risk that we have now. Okay. So the risk reward on this looks great, but that graph is a little bit deceiving. It's $100 at its biggest peak. It's trading for it looks like around, see if we're with the closing trade is about 50 somewhat sense it looks like. The spread's trading for around half of its possible profit. It's giving you some short delta's in the front month, which you will lose as soon as expiration goes off, which is in three days, or this position moves away. Makes sense? Okay. So why don't we close that position, take the profit, to win, win, great trade, and turn it into a different position in September that'll give you some short delta's there. And we'll leave the Netflix trade on and we'll leave the TLT trade on. All right. So this one will be like around $90 total profit on the overall trade that you put on that's correct. You need about 40 cents before and whatever this is trading for 50 cents or something like that, or pretty close to it. Oh, let's go into 50 cents and see what happens. We can always change it later on. Now you do want the stock to be at 209 at expiration. The stock is 209 81, but that's at Friday, not today. Yeah. Okay. So do we get filled on that? Did not get filled on that? Okay. So why don't we cancel and replace it and go down a penny and while he's doing that for us, what he's going to do is click on SPY, edit order, go down to 49 cents. We'll see if we get filled. And if we have to move it again, after the show is over, you'll move it again. Okay. Cool. I want to look at a ratio spread. Let's talk about your positions for a minute. You can go to the option only view if you want. I'm sorry. The view all if you want. Okay. So in Apple, you have a strangle. I just want you to listen to what I say. Apple's a strangle. CNX is a strangle. F-C-X is a strangle. MON is a strangle. EM is a covered call, which is a synthetic short put. I want to get into synthetics. Netflix is a synthetic. It's a butterfly, brokowing butterfly, but it's a synthetic short call spread. OIH is a strangle. The Q's you have an iron condor on. SPY, you have a butterfly on that we're looking to close. TLT, you have an iron condor on, which is really just a short call spread right now because it's right at the money, just in the money. You're short the 121, 124 with a stock at 123 and a half. And then in Twitter, you have a short put, long position. USO, you have a synthetic stock position, short two puts, short one call. And in Win, you have a strangle. So the word that popped out there a lot was a strangle. So I don't want to do anything that involves around a strangle. You're also using around $9,000 of a $30,000 portfolio. So I got to keep that in the back of my mind too. One third of your buying power is not a lot to be using, especially with the IV rank being as low as it is, I think it's pretty active actually. If IV rank was high, I'd want you to be 50%, closer to 80% on a $30,000 portfolio. So SPY is a big product. By big product, I mean, it's trading over $200, right? Yeah. So SPY. So a naked option in SPY would take around $4,000. Now, of all the positions that you have on, you're only using $9,000. All of those strangles, you're only using $9,000 of your overall portfolio. So I want to keep things consistent. What I'd like to do when we're looking at a ratio spread is we like to keep a ratio spread is buying one selling two. A ratio spread can be any, it could be buying four selling five. It could be buying two selling three. We don't like to get any more than one by two.

We typically like to buy the option that's maybe one strike in the money, two strikes in the money, and sell an option that's one strike out of the money or two strikes out of the money. With that in mind, let's go into September and let's look at SPY 31 days to go. You can do a vertical spread and change it if you'd like. We're going to a long call and we'll actually go $3 wide is perfect. And move those strikes down so that my buy is in the money, so $109. Okay, change it. Make it $9.11, make it $2 wide. Okay, now double click on the 11 call and make it two contracts. Okay, if I buy one of the 109 calls, I sell two of the 111 calls. I'm getting about a dollar in credit. Now, that dollar's not as significant as like when we look at a strangle and I tell you we like to collect a dollar, it just happens to be a coincidence here. I want to collect a credit because then I have no risk to one side. I have no risk to the downside. If I have no risk to the downside here, this has to benefit from a short movement or a down movement in the overall market, which is exactly what you are looking to do with your position. This is in September, which gives you some short deltas in September. It's a synthetic short call. That's what it works out to be. Now you break even on this if you click on the little dollar amount is going to be just above your short strike plus the width of the strikes. Being 109, 111, that's $2, right? Plus the credit you received, it switched to 99 cents. It was a dollar before. It gives you a break even of 214. That break even of 214 has about a 67, let's just call it 70% probability of success. It also relies on volatility down ticking. Now, volatility is not high in SPY right now. It's 21%. But we're trying to get synthetic short deltas. We're trying to get short deltas in your overall portfolio and we're replacing one with the other. Let's go into a chart of SPY just quickly. Now, I'm not going to make a great case here and I'm not going to argue and you certainly could argue that the IV rank is not high enough in here. At a 20% implied volatility was actually a little bit higher before, but at a 20% implied volatility, it's been as high as 60 over the last five months.

I'm buying a call spread, which is kind of something you would do in a low implied volatility and I'm selling another call not to finance it because I need short deltas. Does that make sense? So, are you starting to just sell a call, but I don't think the IV rank warrants it. So, we'll be close to 50 delta short on this, right? Because we're the two at the money call. It'll be less, they're not at the money. Stocks 109, sorry, 209 and you're selling the 211. Oh, 211, okay. So, it only gives you about 10, 12 short deltas, not as much as you think. They will grow as the stock moves higher. What's the best price for this? Where do you want the stock to be at expiration? In between? No, I'll give you a hint. Typically all the strategies that we do, you want the stock to be right at your short strike. 211, think about it. The 209 call, this was expiration, 31 days from now is going to be worth how much? It's going to have no extrinsic value, it's going to be parity. How much would it be worth? Nothing. No, the 209 call. Stocks at 211. If it goes to 211? Yes. It'd be worth $2. Exactly. You're selling the, what would the 211 calls be worth if the stock was 211? Nothing, that. Zero. Your own is worth $2. The calls you're short are nothing. You got a dollar premium, and credit in this, you make $3 on a $2 move. Yes, it goes to 211 because then I can sell the long position for the $2-ish. So it's a short position because you have no risk to the downside, but you really want 211. It's kind of like an, it's not an iron condo, but it's kind of like, you know, it's okay if it goes higher or just not too high. And you break evens all the way up to 214. Okay. That's going to use around $4,000 in buying power. That's too much buying power. So let's define our risk, but it's really not to find, it is defining your risk, but it's going to lower our buying power significantly. Now, you know, if you had a million dollar account, maybe you do this trade because $4,000 doesn't matter to you. If you did 10 contracts, $40,000 in buying power doesn't matter to you. But you, you can only control what you have, and that's how much money you have. So let's buy and add the money call. Let's look to buy like the 219 call. Like a broken wing butterfly. Exactly. It's a broken wing butterfly. I mean, like we start out, I just, so if you can break down all these positions, like, like we just started out as a ratio spread, you say, well, that makes it a broken wing butterfly. Yeah, it does make it a broken wing butterfly, not in the classic sense because it's $8 wide by $2 wide. But yes, it's a broken wing butterfly. It doesn't change your probably success, you know, by more than a percentage point or two. It does take away some of your credit, but you get to save $3,500 in buying power to use some place else. And that's more important. That's a lot more powerful. You're increasing your return on capital by doing that. Let's put this in 87 cents is the mid price. Let's go in at 87 cents and we'll see if, you know, let's leave it there right at 88 cents. It could firm and send it send. And when you get filled on one, we'll move the other one. If you don't get filled on the other one, we'll move them both. Make sense? Cool. Yeah. All right, let's just take a quick second here to recap on what we talked about. We talked about looking at your overall portfolio and where your deltas are. Meaning, are they in August or they September? We talked about it yesterday, how they're mostly your short deltas mostly in August. Your long adulta was mostly in September. So what we tried to do today with the ratio spread is take off some of that short delta in August and replace it with short delta in September. Okay? Yeah. Okay, cool. You all right? Yeah. All right, good for you. And you had a nice winner on a broken wing butterfly of 90 bucks. Yeah. That's a lot. Yeah. On a small $2 wide, broken wing butterfly. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. What do I normally say? Peace. Yeah.

Transcript:  I'm gonna go back to the next episode. I'm gonna go back to the next episode. I'm gonna go back to the next episode. Nicky we're back. Where do I start? Bat vs Bat? How are you today? Good. It's been a much better day than yesterday. Okay. All right. So that's a half-empty scenario. And I love that. Yes. Yes. I mean, I got a good good idea. I don't know if we can talk about it while you're doing it because it's unrealistic expectations. You know, you're you're you're down around $4,000 in your account on the clothes yesterday. You're up about $1,500 in the account that's not typical swings in a market. Especially you trade one contract at a time. With this kind of volatility. It's just not it's just not typical. Well, the other side was not to have three days like this and be positive again. Yeah. Like you can't expect tomorrow to make $1500 even if the market goes your direction and make $1500 the following day and be up $500. You just don't have that kind of you know, delta risk in your account. Now let's look at your delta and it's not weighted. So let's click on weighted and go to beta waiting and we'll set it to spy. So what we're doing is we're looking at everything you don't understand what you're looking at. You're looking at $25.00. But when we click on it and we compare it all to spy you long 128 delta. Now you filled one order already. When we open it up you sold an iwm call spread. You didn't have a position in iwm. We're looking to reduce some delta. You reduced about 20 some delta. Not a ton. 15 20% of the time maybe 10% now with where the market is. Okay. So good day. So it's positive. Harble days in the past. Those were negatives. But we got to move forward a little bit. Okay. So you have a month santo trade that you want to talk about. Open up month santo for a moment. Stocks acting horribly today. Although it was much higher today. I think there are you know. You got up to like 23 24 at one point and then it's kind of been back and forth. It opened to 26 and change. So it was really like right up to where you wanted it to be and stay. 95 call and the excuse me the 95 put in the 99 call. You want the stock to go higher 96. Yes. You know on its way to where you wanted it to be but it's not anymore 91. So what did you want to do here? I was going to roll down the calls to. Give it a trade page please. Bring it all the way down to 95. Okay. Cuts are delta by about 15. Which is 15 of the 20 that you have. Of the 20 that I have. Okay. So the first thing I love to do when I'm looking to reduce delta in my account is go to the positions that I have and reduce delta there. As opposed to adding someplace else like you added an I WM which I'm perfectly happy with. But I also like to reduce to the product of what I have. Okay. So you wanted to roll down this month santo. What's the call that you have? I think it's the. I thought I was higher delta than that. What do you mean higher delta? I'm showing that one at like 50 delta's. And that up that current months. It might have been. Was it beta weighted when I was looking at it? Let's go back to the you're probably correct. Yeah. Because I saw it at like. Yeah, unbated weighted. I'm so sorry. It was beta weighted to SPY. Yeah. I apologize. So you know 50 delta. So I cut it by. Me mean 20 percent. 20 percent. Okay. So maybe we have to go a little bit further. So let's take a look. Great catch. That's great. So you want to do a. There we go. So you short the 99 call. You want to go down to the 95. Yeah, to the 95. And then there'd be a straddle essentially is where I would be at that point. Okay. Let's do it. Sounds good to me. I mean, there's no wrong. There's no wrong answer. Let's see what we can do this for. The only thing that I see bad with this trade is you've got 11 cent wide market on the 96. Excuse me on the 95 call. And let's go up to that out of the money call. It's kind of a little bit better at 17 cents or something like that. All right. So it looks like an 89 cent credit, 91 cent credit now. Let me show you a little bit of a trick. Change that cell to a buy. Okay. So you notice how if I want to buy this spread, it's 92 cents. Go back to the cell. If I want to sell this spread, it's 91 cents. That tells me that each option is not the same width between the bid and the ask. Okay. So you have to be careful. Like when you have a wide market in any of these apps, you have to be careful with your price discovery. Like don't just automatically go in at like 91 cents because it might actually be a 92 bid. And you could have gotten 92 or 93. Okay. So since we just saw that and I don't think you're going to get filled at 91 cents or 92 cents, I think you're actually probably have to go down about 87 cents or 86 cents. But let's take a look. Let's go up to 92 cents and hit confirm and send and send. Let it work and then we'll change it after the show is over. Okay. Okay. So you're going to roll down that. You're going to reduce some delta. So I love that. You had one other that you wanted to talk about. And then on my Twitter trade, I just have a naked put right now. So if I sell a naked call on there, I'm not using any more buying power. Correct. You are 100% correct. And it would cut my delta by about 20, 20, 20, 28. So it was like a third when I was looking at it about 20 minutes ago. So I mean, you cut it in by a third. Right. You have Twitter on its lows for today, which doesn't mean anything. It's just been a big and I own it from significantly higher prices too. So yeah, I look at Twitter as a takeover candidate. But you want to know something. I don't think you can. And I think the mechanical thing to do, like I can't sell calls in there. Because I look at it as a takeover candidate. I've been long it's so long. I just want to be sure puts I want the direction I'll delta in there. But let me take a step back. I also have other positions that are significantly shorter than what you have. Yeah. So everything has to be taken by itself and on its own account. So if you want to sell the 28 call, is that what you wanted to take? Yeah, I mean, that's what I was thinking along the same lines of what I was doing with Mount Santa. Of course, you know extra buying power. You're reducing your delta. I get it. You know. I'll do it. We'll deal with the stock. We'll deal with the stock $5 higher. It'll be a high class problem. Okay. Okay. Okay. Remember what we talked about probability of in the money on that option is 23%. So what's the probability of the stock touching it in the next 24 days? 46. That's correct. It's about double. Okay. Let's go in and sell one of those calls. Let's go in at 75 cents and we can adjust it later on. And if it touches, isn't that like almost best case scenario for me at this point? If it touches in 24 days, it will be the best case scenario. Yeah, that's correct. If it touches tomorrow, it'll be good, not as good. Okay. Okay. If it touches in two weeks, it'll be a good scenario. Yeah. If I go in at 75 cents, it's fine. You're going to change the world's market right now. There you go. It's your offer. It's your one contract is now changing the market disseminated across the world. Pretty exciting. Yeah. I mean, when you think about it, it really is. Okay. Okay. Can I show you one other thing that we could have done in Twitter, but I didn't want to confuse you? Yeah. Okay. So we always talk about how you can roll. Okay. We always talk about how you could roll to the following month and pick up some less delta and some premium. Let me show you how to price that role. So for argument six, let's say you want to reduce your delta, but you didn't want to have any upside risk. Like, I don't want to have any upside risk in Twitter. You don't mind having upside risk and it fits your account. There's no wrong answer. But let me show you something that I might have done in this account. Okay. With this type of trade. All right. Let's look at buying back the September 28 put and selling out, if you just close, you just got filled at 75 cents. And closing out the, so we're closing out the September and sell the October 28 put. How much do you think you're going to be able to do that for? Well, click on it. Just, just click on it. So it says a mid price of around 37 cents. Okay. How do we know that price is accurate? Now it's 40 cents. We really don't. Because the market's wide in there. Look at the call side. Just remember one thing. Everything has its own relationship mirrored by the other side. Calls and puts have the same, remember, remember I told you like, like right now, if you looked at that 28 put in October, how much extrinsic value does it have? Let's say it's at $25 stock. We'll say $3.3 in 10 cents. An extrinsic value. That's intrinsic value. So how much extrinsic value does it have? How much premium does it have? Let me give you a quick little way of looking at it. Just look at the call side. About $1.20. Okay. Put minus call equals parity. Here. Change positions to intrinsic value. So the, the call is worth nothing. It's all premium. The put is worth $3.10, but it's trading at $4.25. Oh, so you're paying $10 or $15? In extrinsic value. Okay. Because it still has... Because anything could happen. Yeah. Nobody's going to sell you something at parity. And let's do it from the last margin. Now right now at expiration, they will. Or a penny or two above. That's extrinsic value contraction over the next 52 days. So if I ask you right now, the 30 puts, take intrinsic value off and just change it to position again. Correct. We're in a time. And just go, go to a lower put, like a 25 put. How much extrinsic value does the 25 put have? Not much. $3.50. Extrinsic value. How much does it have? The difference between the calls and the puts are $5. No. So extrinsic value is premium. Intrinsic value is parity. With the stock at 25, how much is that put worth at expiration? Zero. So how much extrinsic value... That's the whole price of it. To $37. Correct. How much extrinsic value does the 26 put have? $1.93. Right. $1.90, $2.91. Somewhere around $1.90. Okay. Go to another month. Go to November if they have November apps. Go to December. Go... Okay. Stop. Go a little bit further down. Go to the 28 put. How much extrinsic value does the 28 put have? What do we add? $3.50. No. Stop looking at the... No. Stop looking at the stock. Just look at the posing call. The 28 put. How much extrinsic value does it have? Draw an arrow to the 28 call. Right there. It has around $2.35 in extrinsic value. How much extrinsic value does the 30 put have? The 30 put. $3.65. No. Don't get it. Extrinsic value is premium over parity. All you have to do is look at the call. The call tells you what price the extrinsic value is in the put. So $1.75 is that? Exactly. And is that just for... That's for every stock. Especially stocks that don't have a dividend. Stock has a dividend. It could be a little bit different. Okay. Twitter doesn't have a dividend. All right. So we ran out of time here. But I want to do it one more time. So you just stay right where you are. The 27 put in December has how much premium? How much extrinsic value? 264. Perfect. Okay. Go to Netflix. I'm so sorry. I got you. I'll get rid of that. Okay. Go to an in-the-money put. I prefer... I prefer September, October. I mean, but it doesn't matter. Okay. Stay right there. The 122.86 put in December has approximately how much premium extrinsic value? $7.45. Somewhere between $7.45 and $8.30. Let's just say $8.30. $8.30. Okay. Every put up there, you should be able to, from here on out, tell me how much extrinsic value. And it's the same thing with the call. Go up to the call for a moment. I'm sorry. Tim goes along with you like. Stop right there. The 90 call has how much extrinsic value in it? 90 call. It's got none. It's a negative. It's 22 on the call side and... Everything is a mirror image of itself. The 90 call has how much extrinsic value? $7.30. Between $7.30 and $7.70, around $7.50. All right. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. Peace.

Transcript:  I'm gonna go back to the next episode. I'm gonna go back to the next episode. I'm gonna go back to the next episode. Nicky we're back. Where do I start? Bat vs Bat? How are you today? Good. It's been a much better day than yesterday. Okay. All right. So that's a half-empty scenario. And I love that. Yes. Yes. I mean, I got a good good idea. I don't know if we can talk about it while you're doing it because it's unrealistic expectations. You know, you're you're you're down around $4,000 in your account on the clothes yesterday. You're up about $1,500 in the account that's not typical swings in a market. Especially you trade one contract at a time. With this kind of volatility. It's just not it's just not typical. Well, the other side was not to have three days like this and be positive again. Yeah. Like you can't expect tomorrow to make $1500 even if the market goes your direction and make $1500 the following day and be up $500. You just don't have that kind of you know, delta risk in your account. Now let's look at your delta and it's not weighted. So let's click on weighted and go to beta waiting and we'll set it to spy. So what we're doing is we're looking at everything you don't understand what you're looking at. You're looking at $25.00. But when we click on it and we compare it all to spy you long 128 delta. Now you filled one order already. When we open it up you sold an iwm call spread. You didn't have a position in iwm. We're looking to reduce some delta. You reduced about 20 some delta. Not a ton. 15 20% of the time maybe 10% now with where the market is. Okay. So good day. So it's positive. Harble days in the past. Those were negatives. But we got to move forward a little bit. Okay. So you have a month santo trade that you want to talk about. Open up month santo for a moment. Stocks acting horribly today. Although it was much higher today. I think there are you know. You got up to like 23 24 at one point and then it's kind of been back and forth. It opened to 26 and change. So it was really like right up to where you wanted it to be and stay. 95 call and the excuse me the 95 put in the 99 call. You want the stock to go higher 96. Yes. You know on its way to where you wanted it to be but it's not anymore 91. So what did you want to do here? I was going to roll down the calls to. Give it a trade page please. Bring it all the way down to 95. Okay. Cuts are delta by about 15. Which is 15 of the 20 that you have. Of the 20 that I have. Okay. So the first thing I love to do when I'm looking to reduce delta in my account is go to the positions that I have and reduce delta there. As opposed to adding someplace else like you added an I WM which I'm perfectly happy with. But I also like to reduce to the product of what I have. Okay. So you wanted to roll down this month santo. What's the call that you have? I think it's the. I thought I was higher delta than that. What do you mean higher delta? I'm showing that one at like 50 delta's. And that up that current months. It might have been. Was it beta weighted when I was looking at it? Let's go back to the you're probably correct. Yeah. Because I saw it at like. Yeah, unbated weighted. I'm so sorry. It was beta weighted to SPY. Yeah. I apologize. So you know 50 delta. So I cut it by. Me mean 20 percent. 20 percent. Okay. So maybe we have to go a little bit further. So let's take a look. Great catch. That's great. So you want to do a. There we go. So you short the 99 call. You want to go down to the 95. Yeah, to the 95. And then there'd be a straddle essentially is where I would be at that point. Okay. Let's do it. Sounds good to me. I mean, there's no wrong. There's no wrong answer. Let's see what we can do this for. The only thing that I see bad with this trade is you've got 11 cent wide market on the 96. Excuse me on the 95 call. And let's go up to that out of the money call. It's kind of a little bit better at 17 cents or something like that. All right. So it looks like an 89 cent credit, 91 cent credit now. Let me show you a little bit of a trick. Change that cell to a buy. Okay. So you notice how if I want to buy this spread, it's 92 cents. Go back to the cell. If I want to sell this spread, it's 91 cents. That tells me that each option is not the same width between the bid and the ask. Okay. So you have to be careful. Like when you have a wide market in any of these apps, you have to be careful with your price discovery. Like don't just automatically go in at like 91 cents because it might actually be a 92 bid. And you could have gotten 92 or 93. Okay. So since we just saw that and I don't think you're going to get filled at 91 cents or 92 cents, I think you're actually probably have to go down about 87 cents or 86 cents. But let's take a look. Let's go up to 92 cents and hit confirm and send and send. Let it work and then we'll change it after the show is over. Okay. Okay. So you're going to roll down that. You're going to reduce some delta. So I love that. You had one other that you wanted to talk about. And then on my Twitter trade, I just have a naked put right now. So if I sell a naked call on there, I'm not using any more buying power. Correct. You are 100% correct. And it would cut my delta by about 20, 20, 20, 28. So it was like a third when I was looking at it about 20 minutes ago. So I mean, you cut it in by a third. Right. You have Twitter on its lows for today, which doesn't mean anything. It's just been a big and I own it from significantly higher prices too. So yeah, I look at Twitter as a takeover candidate. But you want to know something. I don't think you can. And I think the mechanical thing to do, like I can't sell calls in there. Because I look at it as a takeover candidate. I've been long it's so long. I just want to be sure puts I want the direction I'll delta in there. But let me take a step back. I also have other positions that are significantly shorter than what you have. Yeah. So everything has to be taken by itself and on its own account. So if you want to sell the 28 call, is that what you wanted to take? Yeah, I mean, that's what I was thinking along the same lines of what I was doing with Mount Santa. Of course, you know extra buying power. You're reducing your delta. I get it. You know. I'll do it. We'll deal with the stock. We'll deal with the stock $5 higher. It'll be a high class problem. Okay. Okay. Okay. Remember what we talked about probability of in the money on that option is 23%. So what's the probability of the stock touching it in the next 24 days? 46. That's correct. It's about double. Okay. Let's go in and sell one of those calls. Let's go in at 75 cents and we can adjust it later on. And if it touches, isn't that like almost best case scenario for me at this point? If it touches in 24 days, it will be the best case scenario. Yeah, that's correct. If it touches tomorrow, it'll be good, not as good. Okay. Okay. If it touches in two weeks, it'll be a good scenario. Yeah. If I go in at 75 cents, it's fine. You're going to change the world's market right now. There you go. It's your offer. It's your one contract is now changing the market disseminated across the world. Pretty exciting. Yeah.

So it says a mid price of around 37 cents. Okay. How do we know that price is accurate? Now it's 40 cents. We really don't. Because the market's wide in there. Look at the call side.

Transcript:  We're back. Where do I start? Bat vs. Bat? How are you today? It's going okay today. I'm seeing a little bit of green on some of my positions, but it's still not where I want to be. Okay, that's okay. So listen, is trading easier tough? It's tough. It's definitely tough, but I mean... So what would you have said about a month ago or something like that or six weeks ago when you first started? What would you say about trading? No, I would have said like let's go shopping because I mean it's some good trades. Right. And it seems like easier from the outside, doesn't it? Yeah. Like if you're watching from the outside and you haven't done anything, oh, markets are going to high low. You buy here, you sell here. It's a lot different when you have money on the line. You got to make the decision. Yeah, and this has been like, I mean my first significant loss. This is a bigger loss I think Katie ever had and she was trading for like two years. Let's take a look at your account there and she was my first student that we had live on the show. So you're really overperforming. Depends on how you look at it. I'm just kidding, your son. You're up about 700 bucks in your account for today. You're down about $3,000 overall. I was talking to you a little bit before the show started. I don't really like to do that. But I was saying, you know what? You don't have a lot of you don't have a lot of beta in your account that's going to like help you make back that money unless you get real big directional moves in the direction that you need in the stocks that kind of hurt you. You know, I mean like you don't have enough premium that you can sell to make up $3,000. It's trading small without taking on limit without taking extra large amount of risks in your account to make up that. So you got to think to yourself, okay, it's going to be a longer time horizon. It might take me the rest of the year. It might take me six months. It might take me three months depending on how volatility goes. It might take you five months and you get lucky on a couple of plays and volatility works your direction too. It's not a hopeless cause, but you just witnessed over the last couple of days something that Katie, when we were doing it, never experienced in her life and something that traders for the last five or seven years have never traded and have never experienced in their life, which is basically a two or three standard deviation. I mean a stock like when has moved 30% in the last three weeks. It gives me nightmares. Right. It's not like, you know, it's a biotech stock that lost a patent or something like that or didn't get approved on something. I mean, it's it's an established stock. Yeah. But at least you have a respect now for the market. Now yesterday, we went through an intrinsic and extrinsic value and I never got to my takeaway on what I wanted to talk about. So I wanted to use the example and the takeaway in win today. So let's go to win and we can talk about that. Now I'll just while you're while you're going there, I'll just and change that from intrinsic to tasty trade on the top. I'm sorry on the top. There you go. Okay. So, a strangle gone gone bad. You keep rolling down the untested side. Let's go to September. Let's go to state September show. We have, I'm sorry. Now you can change return on capital to the position. I apologize. It's like the 90 put and 81 call. So you're inverted. Let's take a look at the 90 put for a minute. Yesterday we talked about intrinsic and extrinsic value and I hope that I drove home the point for you. But let's see if I did. How much extrinsic value does the 90 put have 60 cents? Right. Well, and how are you getting that number? It's the it's the call side. You're just looking at the call side. Whatever the call side is trading for, that's going to they mirror each other. So here. So click on position. Instead of position, make it intrinsic value. Well, you know what I'm sorry, make it extrinsic value. You'll be able to see it on the put a little bit easier. Okay. So the extrinsic value in the put is 61 cents. You notice the 95 or the 90 and a half put there. It shows an extrinsic value of a dollar 26. But the 90 and a half call has how much extrinsic value? No, 57 cents, 58 cents. So you know that something's not wrong there, but that market is so much wider than that 90 and a half put. Now the reason why I wanted to show you this little trade hack about how we find intrinsic and extrinsic value very quickly, change that extrinsic value back to the positions, please. Is because when you're rolling an option that's deep in the money and you have wide markets, even in something like a $73 stock like when price discovery, especially if you only have one contract, is going to be paramount. It's going to be king. Plus if you can understand how to get that price, then you'll forever be, never have to be at the mercy of the market. You'll always know what a good market is. And by good market, I just mean a fair and just one. So let's roll. Remember, all options September, October, November, December are exactly the same. We tried going through that a little bit yesterday. If I'm looking at a put that's trading for $20 and the call is trading for $1 on the same strike, it's going to have $1 of extrinsic value with no dividend in the stock. There's no dividend here. Okay. Let's buy back the 90 put and roll it to September. Now you should be, I should roll it to October. So all we're doing is we're trying to buy ourselves some time and get a little bit of premium. Now take a look at the 90 put for a moment here in October. So you're short to September. We're going to buy that one back. And at the same time, if we wanted to do this, we would sell the October 90 put. The call in September was trading for around 60 cents. Do you remember that? Yes. What's the extrinsic value in the 90 put? Let's say 140. So 60 and 140, 60 minus 140, about 80 cents. Let's click on the 80 put, selling it. So the credit received here is 75 cents. Okay. That's in the ballpark. Yeah. Because we know change that put to call right there. Yes. And it should be around the same price. Now we figured out that it was going to be 80 cents. And when we went to the put side, click it again. It said 75 cents. So if I was looking to put this, if I was looking to do this trade, I would probably route this order at 81, 82, 80, 79 cents. But I wouldn't route it at 77 cents. Because it's probably worth a little bit more. Does that make sense? It's understating the extrinsic value. Well, here, now, now the market's got tight enough where it's basically perfect. But what will happen is when you're trying to roll a trade like this or you're trading a product that has really wide markets and you don't know how to do your own price discovery, your own market awareness, because you know that one mirrors the other, you put something in a mid price. If you put something in a 90 cents right here, you say, well, it's mid price. I should be filled. You know what? I'm going to move it down four or five cents off of mid price. I'm going to go down to 85 cents right here. And look, it's a dollar now. Yeah. You're not going to get filled because that's that is the true market. But it's not the fair market. Click on the change that put to call again. It's really around 83 cents. So a lot of times I'll get emails from people and say, hey, you know, I'm in at mid price or I've actually moved it, you know, two or three cents off of mid price. And we always talk about how in liquid products, and I would consider when a liquid product, how you typically get filled, especially when there's really no delta risk here, look at the delta on the, you can change position from 90 to delta. The delta on the 90 put here in October is 81 in September. It's probably going to be 90 go up to September. So there's no delta risk to the counterparty. Meaning it's basically just a carry trade. How long do I want to carry this for for the amount of it? You know, it's 89. So there's no delta risk. So if the stock were to move a dollar, this spread is not going to move much. It's going to maybe move a penny. It makes sense. There's no risk to the other side. So all we need to know is what's fair value. And the only way to get fair value in deep products like this here, go to Amazon for a moment. I'm just going to Amazon because of $500 stock. And I don't think there are too many people that are naked short options, especially put options because it takes so much buying power. But let's just say that you are, let's go deep in the money for a minute, like go up to $5.50 or something like that. Let's see. You can stay right there. $5.40 is fine. Look at how wide that market is on the $5.40 puts. It's almost $3.00. Yeah. I mean, it's really wide. So if I want here, buy the September 540 put and sell the October 540 put. Let's just say for argument, say, I'm just simulating a trade right now that you had a position in Amazon and you wanted to roll it from September to October. The credit you're receiving here is $5.65. Let's change the put to call. It should be if that pricing, look at how wide the market is. $3.40 to $5.77. Let's change it to call. Well, it's a dollar difference. $6.15. But here, you only have a 25 cent wide market, 30 cent wide market. Now it's $0.35. Do you understand what I'm saying? So from a change back to puts, to do the put side, you've got an over $2.30 wide market. Much harder to do price discovery. Go to call side. So the call side is trading for $6.15. That means the put side, change back to puts, should be trading somewhere around $6.15. So a lot of times what will happen is somebody will put an order in a $5.50, get filled at $5.80 or $6.75 and say, wow, I got a great fill. Did they get a great fill? Probably not. They probably sold it too cheap. Now that's assuming that there's no dividends or anything else like that. If you have dividends and you have to add the dividend into the stock, put side you really don't usually have dividend issue because there's no puts don't have dividend. If you're sure to put, nobody's going to put stock to you so you can collect the dividend. So the put side typically trades true. The call side would not trade true if there was a dividend in September. We can get the dividends when we face that. Okay. Yeah. Alright. So that's why I want to teach you intrinsic and extrinsic value today. I know we didn't make a trade in your account today. Let's go back to your account statement tab for a moment. You're a minor tab. I apologize. Alright, so you're up $850 markets rallying a little bit. You're definitely holding long deltas. Let's beta weight your position. SPY. You probably have about 100 deltas. You got 95 now. Okay. So you look at what you've opened up my Santo for a moment. Your my Santo is making a bid for a company. We rolled down the calls to 95. It probably costs us about 150 bucks in there. But you know what? You want the stock to be around 95 at expiration. There's nothing you can do. When we didn't, we did roll down. Go to win. And the stock still down $1.50 today. So, you know, we're zicking when we should zag. We said we're zagging when we should zig. But we're still doing all the mechanical things that let the let the large, large, large numbers come into play. Alright. So we got to do something with win. So your options are to roll down your call like we typically do. Do nothing or roll the whole position to October. There's no wrong answer. I actually personally think you should just sit and do nothing. If the stock rallies, then we can do it into strength. That would be my opinion. Alright, let's take a quick break here for just a second or just just go over what we talked about today. So today was kind of a two-parter. I didn't finish what I my whole thought yesterday. But we had to learn about intrinsic and extrinsic value so that we could then learn a little bit of a trade hack on how to price deep in the money options when you have to roll them or just price them out. Period. If you wanted to buy a deep in the money option or sell a deep in the in the money option, you know if it has a wide market that's $3, $4 wide, all you have to figure out is the intrinsic value and then how much the other side is trading for to get the fair and true price of that option or the spread that you want it, the count spread that you would want to sell. Okay? Yeah. Alright, good job, Addy based on. And a better job out of your account too. Hey, listen, you got you got back 20% of your losses. Has it make you feel? That's a lot better. Still a long way to go. Yes you do. What do I normally say? Peace. Peace. See you next time.

Transcript:  We're back. Where do I start? Bat vs. Bat? How are you today? It's going okay today. I'm seeing a little bit of green on some of my positions, but it's still not where I want to be. Okay, that's okay. So listen, is trading easier tough? It's tough. It's definitely tough, but I mean... So what would you have said about a month ago or something like that or six weeks ago when you first started? What would you say about trading? No, I would have said like let's go shopping because I mean it's some good trades. Right. And it seems like easier from the outside, doesn't it? Yeah. Like if you're watching from the outside and you haven't done anything, oh, markets are going to high low. You buy here, you sell here. It's a lot different when you have money on the line. You got to make the decision. Yeah, and this has been like, I mean my first significant loss. This is a bigger loss I think Katie ever had and she was trading for like two years. Let's take a look at your account there and she was my first student that we had live on the show. So you're really overperforming. Depends on how you look at it. I'm just kidding, your son. You're up about 700 bucks in your account for today. You're down about $3,000 overall. I was talking to you a little bit before the show started. I don't really like to do that. But I was saying, you know what? You don't have a lot of you don't have a lot of beta in your account that's going to like help you make back that money unless you get real big directional moves in the direction that you need in the stocks that kind of hurt you. You know, I mean like you don't have enough premium that you can sell to make up $3,000. It's trading small without taking on limit without taking extra large amount of risks in your account to make up that. So you got to think to yourself, okay, it's going to be a longer time horizon. It might take me the rest of the year. It might take me six months. It might take me three months depending on how volatility goes. It might take you five months and you get lucky on a couple of plays and volatility works your direction too. It's not a hopeless cause, but you just witnessed over the last couple of days something that Katie, when we were doing it, never experienced in her life and something that traders for the last five or seven years have never traded and have never experienced in their life, which is basically a two or three standard deviation. I mean a stock like when has moved 30% in the last three weeks. It gives me nightmares. Right. It's not like, you know, it's a biotech stock that lost a patent or something like that or didn't get approved on something. I mean, it's it's an established stock. Yeah. But at least you have a respect now for the market. Now yesterday, we went through an intrinsic and extrinsic value and I never got to my takeaway on what I wanted to talk about. So I wanted to use the example and the takeaway in win today. So let's go to win and we can talk about that. Now I'll just while you're while you're going there, I'll just and change that from intrinsic to tasty trade on the top. I'm sorry on the top. There you go. Okay. So, a strangle gone gone bad. You keep rolling down the untested side. Let's go to September. Let's go to state September show. We have, I'm sorry. Now you can change return on capital to the position. I apologize. It's like the 90 put and 81 call. So you're inverted. Let's take a look at the 90 put for a minute. Yesterday we talked about intrinsic and extrinsic value and I hope that I drove home the point for you. But let's see if I did. How much extrinsic value does the 90 put have 60 cents? Right. Well, and how are you getting that number? It's the it's the call side. You're just looking at the call side. Whatever the call side is trading for, that's going to they mirror each other. So here. So click on position. Instead of position, make it intrinsic value. Well, you know what I'm sorry, make it extrinsic value. You'll be able to see it on the put a little bit easier. Okay. So the extrinsic value in the put is 61 cents. You notice the 95 or the 90 and a half put there. It shows an extrinsic value of a dollar 26. But the 90 and a half call has how much extrinsic value? No, 57 cents, 58 cents. So you know that something's not wrong there, but that market is so much wider than that 90 and a half put. Now the reason why I wanted to show you this little trade hack about how we find intrinsic and extrinsic value very quickly, change that extrinsic value back to the positions, please. Is because when you're rolling an option that's deep in the money and you have wide markets, even in something like a $73 stock like when price discovery, especially if you only have one contract, is going to be paramount. It's going to be king. Plus if you can understand how to get that price, then you'll forever be, never have to be at the mercy of the market. You'll always know what a good market is. And by good market, I just mean a fair and just one. So let's roll. Remember, all options September, October, November, December are exactly the same. We tried going through that a little bit yesterday. If I'm looking at a put that's trading for $20 and the call is trading for $1 on the same strike, it's going to have $1 of extrinsic value with no dividend in the stock. There's no dividend here. Okay. Let's buy back the 90 put and roll it to September. Now you should be, I should roll it to October. So all we're doing is we're trying to buy ourselves some time and get a little bit of premium. Now take a look at the 90 put for a moment here in October. So you're short to September. We're going to buy that one back. And at the same time, if we wanted to do this, we would sell the October 90 put. The call in September was trading for around 60 cents. Do you remember that? Yes. What's the extrinsic value in the 90 put? Let's say 140. So 60 and 140, 60 minus 140, about 80 cents. Let's click on the 80 put, selling it. So the credit received here is 75 cents. Okay. That's in the ballpark. Yeah. Because we know change that put to call right there. Yes. And it should be around the same price. Now we figured out that it was going to be 80 cents. And when we went to the put side, click it again. It said 75 cents. So if I was looking to put this, if I was looking to do this trade, I would probably route this order at 81, 82, 80, 79 cents. But I wouldn't route it at 77 cents. Because it's probably worth a little bit more. Does that make sense? It's understating the extrinsic value. Well, here, now, now the market's got tight enough where it's basically perfect. But what will happen is when you're trying to roll a trade like this or you're trading a product that has really wide markets and you don't know how to do your own price discovery, your own market awareness, because you know that one mirrors the other, you put something in a mid price. If you put something in a 90 cents right here, you say, well, it's mid price. I should be filled. You know what? I'm going to move it down four or five cents off of mid price. I'm going to go down to 85 cents right here. And look, it's a dollar now. Yeah. You're not going to get filled because that's that is the true market. But it's not the fair market. Click on the change that put to call again. It's really around 83 cents. So a lot of times I'll get emails from people and say, hey, you know, I'm in at mid price or I've actually moved it, you know, two or three cents off of mid price. And we always talk about how in liquid products, and I would consider when a liquid product, how you typically get filled, especially when there's really no delta risk here, look at the delta on the, you can change position from 90 to delta. The delta on the 90 put here in October is 81 in September. It's probably going to be 90 go up to September. So there's no delta risk to the counterparty. Meaning it's basically just a carry trade. How long do I want to carry this for for the amount of it? You know, it's 89. So there's no delta risk. So if the stock were to move a dollar, this spread is not going to move much. It's going to maybe move a penny. It makes sense. There's no risk to the other side. So all we need to know is what's fair value. And the only way to get fair value in deep products like this here, go to Amazon for a moment. I'm just going to Amazon because of $500 stock. And I don't think there are too many people that are naked short options, especially put options because it takes so much buying power. But let's just say that you are, let's go deep in the money for a minute, like go up to $5.50 or something like that. Let's see. You can stay right there. $5.40 is fine. Look at how wide that market is on the $5.40 puts. It's almost $3.00. Yeah. I mean, it's really wide. So if I want here, buy the September 540 put and sell the October 540 put. Let's just say for argument, say, I'm just simulating a trade right now that you had a position in Amazon and you wanted to roll it from September to October. The credit you're receiving here is $5.65. Let's change the put to call. It should be if that pricing, look at how wide the market is. $3.40 to $5.77. Let's change it to call. Well, it's a dollar difference. $6.15. But here, you only have a 25 cent wide market, 30 cent wide market. Now it's $0.35. Do you understand what I'm saying? So from a change back to puts, to do the put side, you've got an over $2.30 wide market. Much harder to do price discovery. Go to call side. So the call side is trading for $6.15. That means the put side, change back to puts, should be trading somewhere around $6.15. So a lot of times what will happen is somebody will put an order in a $5.50, get filled at $5.80 or $6.75 and say, wow, I got a great fill. Did they get a great fill? Probably not. They probably sold it too cheap. Now that's assuming that there's no dividends or anything else like that. If you have dividends and you have to add the dividend into the stock, put side you really don't usually have dividend issue because there's no puts don't have dividend. If you're sure to put, nobody's going to put stock to you so you can collect the dividend. So the put side typically trades true. The call side would not trade true if there was a dividend in September. We can get the dividends when we face that. Okay. Yeah. Alright. So that's why I want to teach you intrinsic and extrinsic value today. I know we didn't make a trade in your account today. Let's go back to your account statement tab for a moment. You're a minor tab. I apologize. Alright, so you're up $850 markets rallying a little bit. You're definitely holding long deltas. Let's beta weight your position. SPY. You probably have about 100 deltas. You got 95 now. Okay. So you look at what you've opened up my Santo for a moment. Your my Santo is making a bid for a company. We rolled down the calls to 95. It probably costs us about 150 bucks in there. But you know what? You want the stock to be around 95 at expiration. There's nothing you can do. When we didn't, we did roll down. Go to win. And the stock still down $1.50 today. So, you know, we're zicking when we should zag. We said we're zagging when we should zig.

Transcript:  We're back. Where do I start? Bat versus bat. How are you? Good. I'm having, I mean, the last couple days have been better for me, account wise. Still making adjustments. I rolled down stinks, doesn't it? I know. It's really a pain, but... So when you say you make an adjustments, it's because you're accounts not performing the way you want it to, or positions, deltas getting too large. Your portfolio has changed. I mean, that's the dynamic thing about trading, and that's really the dynamic thing about options. You know, if you buy 100 shares of ABC stock, it's always going to be 100 shares. You've defined your risk on entry by buying or selling 100 shares of stock. With options, they change. What could be neutral or negative delta one day, especially when you're getting two 300 point moves in the Dow and 50, 60 point moves in the E-Mini S&Ps, which your first two weeks of trading, we were having $5 ranges. Now we're having $50 ranges. A one standard deviation move was something that was a mythical animal that we would talk about. You had a four, five, and six standard deviation moves in a lot of the products that we've traded. So in a short period of time, good and bad, you've been able to witness something that I don't know if it's going to stay with us for a long time, but eventually we'll go away. So you're at an advantage and you're at a disadvantage because we didn't get a lot of the principles down of trading for you yet. So now we've got an account. Let's take a look at your account. It's down around $2,000, $2,100, and change it looks like. You are up about $800 today. You're only up around $600. I have to tell you, when I first started doing this with Katie, if we had a day where her account, using about the same amount of buying power, moves $50. The whole account, that was a kind of a wild day. I mean, that's how it was for the beginning of our show. Yes. Now what we are, we're in a position which is kind of a good position for those people who are starting to learn how to trade. We're kind of a little bit behind the eight ball. We're not playing from an offensive standpoint. We're kind of playing from a defensive standpoint right now. And by defense, I mean, you're looking at your deltas on your position. Let's beta weight your overall portfolio. So we're just going to click on beta weighting, put an SPY, and you're long about 20 deltas. If you remember the last time we did this, we were long about 150 deltas and about 100 deltas. Now, 2021 deltas. That's just how fast things are moving. My thought for you, when you take a look at this, you know, your biggest delta, your longest delta is there in SPY, 25 long delt, win, which has been a pig. Which has been a pig. And then everything else is pretty much flat, meaning your delta is pretty much flat. So where the market is today is probably, if we were closing here at expiration, a really good price for you. You had some oil-related products and stocks that you've been leaning a little bit long on that you got paid on today, which is nice. So if this was expiration, you'd probably have the majority of your money back. Maybe even be positive, but it's not expiration. Yeah, there's still time. There's still time premium left. So we've got to keep, since we have a portfolio after looking at it, beta weighted to SPY, that's basically neutral with a little bit of long delta, I wanted to come on the show when, before we started the show, the Dow was up around 300 points. It's only up 80 now. And the E-mini S&P's are up 10. They were up 40. I wanted to put on a skewed iron condor, meaning I wanted to sell the call spread a little bit closer than the put spread to give yourself a little bit of negative delta. Now what the market moving the way it is, I kind of want to change it up a little bit. So the only ETF that you don't have up there, equity related, you have a position SPY, you have a position in the queues, you have a position in IWM, the only one missing is the Dow, DIA. So I thought we would take a look at DIA. Let's go into the account state, the charts for a moment, and just take a look at the diamonds, DIA. And see if it fits our criteria. So you got an IV rank of around 63. Truth be told when I was looking at it earlier, it was around 54. So volatility is expanded. That's a good thing for us. It's back into the middle of the range of where it's been recently. You know, this is what I hate about charts and charting. And I only look at it as kind of like a point for you to take a look at. Now I'm watching the market all day long. I know you're doing support out there watching the market all day long with people too. But I know what do you say the ranges? This is a, I think it's a yearly chart or six month chart. What do you say the ranges in the diamonds for the IVR? No, I'm sorry, the stock price. I mean, based on what it's what I'm looking at, I would think you can't do. You can't, you can't base on anything else. 75 is where it was traditionally before the last week. OK, I mean, I would kind of disagree. I mean, the high is 180, the low is 150. Yeah, I mean, that's, that's all, that's all you can say, right? I mean, that's what I mean, that's what it is, right? So let's throw out the high and let's throw out the low. So let's say the low is 155, like throughout the low extreme. Yeah. And let's throw out the high extreme of 185 and say it's 180. So from 180 to 155 has been the range over the last six months. But it's spent five and a half months wrapped around 175, right? Yeah. I mean, that's what I was referring to. So you're right. So we can, because volatility is so high right now and because there's so much craziness in the market for lack of a better word, we can go so much wider than we were able to go before by selling strangles. Now they take a lot of buying power. So what I'd like to do is look at a strangle and then see if we can buy our wings to define our risk. Does that make sense? Yeah. OK, let's go into the trade page. We can just stay right here and toss is fine by me. And open up. Well, what month should we be in? We should be going to the October. That's correct. We're going closest to 45 days. So do we do. So do we do use the weeklies with 43 days? No. Right. I like, I like to stay in the monthly options, especially with a new trader. I'm looking for around 45 days closest to 45 days that brings me to October. We don't have to worry about earnings in an ETF. There are none. So perfect storm. Yeah. High implied volatility. Let's go in October. And let's open up a bunch of strikes. You're going to have to open up like 90. OK, so what do we like to do typically? Like to collect how much credit on a strangle? A third of the width of the. No, on a strangle on a strangle. Right. And they could call and they could put one, collect at least a dollar. So if you were looking at the put side, what put would you be looking to sell? If for a dollar or if we're going to do half and half, what we're going to do is what we're going to do is strangle. So it's half and half, right? Yeah. So we'd go at like the 130 or the 131. Sure. Any any of those from like let's just say 134 to 127 are actually fine. Actually, if you look on the right hand side there, that probability of being in them in the money that 5%. That's like a full standard deviation is 15%. 5% is almost like a two standard deviation move. So now what we couldn't get just a few weeks ago at 15% probability of being in the money, you can get at a 5% probability of being in the money just because volatility has expanded so much. That's correct. So let's just for argument six, you can see the markets are a little bit wide there. You notice from the 29 puts, the 28 puts, 27, but they're all around the same, right? Like same price. Yeah. Look at all the offers on them. They're pennies away. So you can have to do a little bit of price discovery. And when you're trading with one contract, it's going to make it a little bit harder. So you have to go higher on your price and then come down low. So let's just say for argument six, we split the difference and we go in it like the 128 put. Okay. Okay. So we're going to sell one make that one contract, please, and make sure you're in the right account too. Should be account that ends in 81. Okay. Let's go up to the calls. Okay, stop. What call are you going to sell? Yeah. You might have to go up a little bit between like 177 and yeah, right around 177 ish. You notice the probability of being in the money there. What is that? 9%. 9%. It's almost double. That's skew. Meaning you can't get as much for the call as you can for the put. There's more fear to the downside. So those puts are bit higher, even though they're further away from the market. Makes sense? Okay. Let's, since I wanted to skew it a little bit to the downside, give ourselves a little bit of downside delta, let's take that call from 176 ish to 173. Does that work for you? Yeah. Now why pick 173? I really should pick 174 because it's wrapped around that 15% probability of being in the money. Keepers put a circle around that says 1611. So that would keep us outside of a one standard deviation. Exactly. Or right around a one standard deviation move. That's correct. Okay. So we're going further on the put, closer on the call, give ourselves a little bit more short delta. Just hold down the control key and click on the 174. That's fine. Keep muscles really honest. Okay. Now let's go on the call side. Let's go all the way down to define our risk because hit confirm and send one time on that trade. You use about 2200 hours worth of buying power. Not bad. But the way my account is right now. You're using almost 20,000 of a 30,000 dollar account. I want to see if we can tighten that up a little bit. So let's close that. And let's keep in mind that it's 22 dollars or 22 hundred dollars. So let's go up to the calls and see which call can we buy for a nickel or something like that. Okay, stop. It looks like a 84. Yeah, 184, 185. Okay. Let's just go 185 because we're going to have to go further on the call side. So we're $11 right now. Okay. So for five cents, we've built a, we're starting to build an iron condor that's $11 wide. That's going to use $1100 worth of buying power. Actually, $1,000 worth of buying power because you're collecting almost a dollar or the lower a dollar. Yeah. Instead of 2200. So we're cutting in half and paying a nickel. But we got to do something on the put side too. So let's go to the put side. Let's see if we can go 11 points lower and see what happens with selling the 128 put. Let's go to the one 17 put. Now look at the market on the one 17 put. Look at the market on all of those puts. So the 20 put, the 19 put, the 18 put, the 17 put. They're all basically the same price. Yeah. Right. And what we selling the 128 put for? The 128 we're selling for $50. Like $0.50. So if we've got to buy the other one for $0.25. We're selling that wide put spread for 25 cents. It doesn't make much sense. That's awesome. And the fact that you can realize that is really amazing. So just sell the call spread. Okay. So I did. So then it'll be. So if you're looking for short delta, I want to do both sides. I either have to go closer with my iron condor. Or I have to just sell the call spread. So then that keeps us with risk to the downside then. Nope. That keeps us with risk only to the upside in this position. You're selling a call spread. You're going to put or just you can hit customizing change it to zero or whatever. Didn't stand. You're only selling a call spread. Okay. Did I lose you? A little bit. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, we'll talk about it. It's good. I'm going to have to show us over. Let's take a let's just think about what we talked about here today. What I wanted to go over was your whole portfolio. You're long about 20 delta. I wanted to find something that would give you about 20 delta's worth of 20 short delta's. You're long 20 delta's in your portfolio. The object is not to get your portfolio to delta neutral. But you have been riding these delta's up for the last couple of days. The markets accommodated you. Let's look to sell into strength. To neutralize your position a little bit by selling 20 to 50 delta's. If we sell an option that has a 15% probability of being in the money, it has about a 15 delta that would have gotten you just about neutral in your overall position. Cool. All right. Good job out of you. Who comes up next? Tonight. What do I normally say? What do I say?

Transcript:  We're back. Where do I start? Bat versus bat. How are you? Good. I'm having, I mean, the last couple days have been better for me, account wise. Still making adjustments. I rolled down stinks, doesn't it? I know. It's really a pain, but... So when you say you make an adjustments, it's because you're accounts not performing the way you want it to, or positions, deltas getting too large. Your portfolio has changed. I mean, that's the dynamic thing about trading, and that's really the dynamic thing about options. You know, if you buy 100 shares of ABC stock, it's always going to be 100 shares. You've defined your risk on entry by buying or selling 100 shares of stock. With options, they change. What could be neutral or negative delta one day, especially when you're getting two 300 point moves in the Dow and 50, 60 point moves in the E-Mini S&Ps, which your first two weeks of trading, we were having $5 ranges. Now we're having $50 ranges. A one standard deviation move was something that was a mythical animal that we would talk about. You had a four, five, and six standard deviation moves in a lot of the products that we've traded. So in a short period of time, good and bad, you've been able to witness something that I don't know if it's going to stay with us for a long time, but eventually we'll go away. So you're at an advantage and you're at a disadvantage because we didn't get a lot of the principles down of trading for you yet. So now we've got an account. Let's take a look at your account. It's down around $2,000, $2,100, and change it looks like. You are up about $800 today. You're only up around $600. I have to tell you, when I first started doing this with Katie, if we had a day where her account, using about the same amount of buying power, moves $50. The whole account, that was a kind of a wild day. I mean, that's how it was for the beginning of our show. Yes. Now what we are, we're in a position which is kind of a good position for those people who are starting to learn how to trade. We're kind of a little bit behind the eight ball. We're not playing from an offensive standpoint. We're kind of playing from a defensive standpoint right now. And by defense, I mean, you're looking at your deltas on your position. Let's beta weight your overall portfolio. So we're just going to click on beta weighting, put an SPY, and you're long about 20 deltas. If you remember the last time we did this, we were long about 150 deltas and about 100 deltas. Now, 2021 deltas. That's just how fast things are moving. My thought for you, when you take a look at this, you know, your biggest delta, your longest delta is there in SPY, 25 long delt, win, which has been a pig. Which has been a pig. And then everything else is pretty much flat, meaning your delta is pretty much flat. So where the market is today is probably, if we were closing here at expiration, a really good price for you. You had some oil-related products and stocks that you've been leaning a little bit long on that you got paid on today, which is nice. So if this was expiration, you'd probably have the majority of your money back. Maybe even be positive, but it's not expiration. Yeah, there's still time. There's still time premium left. So we've got to keep, since we have a portfolio after looking at it, beta weighted to SPY, that's basically neutral with a little bit of long delta, I wanted to come on the show when, before we started the show, the Dow was up around 300 points. It's only up 80 now. And the E-mini S&P's are up 10. They were up 40. I wanted to put on a skewed iron condor, meaning I wanted to sell the call spread a little bit closer than the put spread to give yourself a little bit of negative delta. Now what the market moving the way it is, I kind of want to change it up a little bit. So the only ETF that you don't have up there, equity related, you have a position SPY, you have a position in the queues, you have a position in IWM, the only one missing is the Dow, DIA. So I thought we would take a look at DIA. Let's go into the account state, the charts for a moment, and just take a look at the diamonds, DIA. And see if it fits our criteria. So you got an IV rank of around 63. Truth be told when I was looking at it earlier, it was around 54. So volatility is expanded. That's a good thing for us. It's back into the middle of the range of where it's been recently. You know, this is what I hate about charts and charting. And I only look at it as kind of like a point for you to take a look at. Now I'm watching the market all day long. I know you're doing support out there watching the market all day long with people too. But I know what do you say the ranges? This is a, I think it's a yearly chart or six month chart. What do you say the ranges in the diamonds for the IVR? No, I'm sorry, the stock price. I mean, based on what it's what I'm looking at, I would think you can't do. You can't, you can't base on anything else. 75 is where it was traditionally before the last week. OK, I mean, I would kind of disagree. I mean, the high is 180, the low is 150. Yeah, I mean, that's, that's all, that's all you can say, right? I mean, that's what I mean, that's what it is, right? So let's throw out the high and let's throw out the low. So let's say the low is 155, like throughout the low extreme. Yeah. And let's throw out the high extreme of 185 and say it's 180. So from 180 to 155 has been the range over the last six months. But it's spent five and a half months wrapped around 175, right? Yeah. I mean, that's what I was referring to. So you're right. So we can, because volatility is so high right now and because there's so much craziness in the market for lack of a better word, we can go so much wider than we were able to go before by selling strangles. Now they take a lot of buying power. So what I'd like to do is look at a strangle and then see if we can buy our wings to define our risk. Does that make sense? Yeah. OK, let's go into the trade page. We can just stay right here and toss is fine by me. And open up. Well, what month should we be in? We should be going to the October. That's correct. We're going closest to 45 days. So do we do. So do we do use the weeklies with 43 days? No. Right. I like, I like to stay in the monthly options, especially with a new trader. I'm looking for around 45 days closest to 45 days that brings me to October. We don't have to worry about earnings in an ETF. There are none. So perfect storm. Yeah. High implied volatility. Let's go in October. And let's open up a bunch of strikes. You're going to have to open up like 90. OK, so what do we like to do typically? Like to collect how much credit on a strangle? A third of the width of the. No, on a strangle on a strangle. Right. And they could call and they could put one, collect at least a dollar. So if you were looking at the put side, what put would you be looking to sell? If for a dollar or if we're going to do half and half, what we're going to do is what we're going to do is strangle. So it's half and half, right? Yeah. So we'd go at like the 130 or the 131. Sure. Any any of those from like let's just say 134 to 127 are actually fine. Actually, if you look on the right hand side there, that probability of being in them in the money that 5%. That's like a full standard deviation is 15%. 5% is almost like a two standard deviation move. So now what we couldn't get just a few weeks ago at 15% probability of being in the money, you can get at a 5% probability of being in the money just because volatility has expanded so much. That's correct. So let's just for argument six, you can see the markets are a little bit wide there. You notice from the 29 puts, the 28 puts, 27, but they're all around the same, right? Like same price. Yeah. Look at all the offers on them. They're pennies away. So you can have to do a little bit of price discovery. And when you're trading with one contract, it's going to make it a little bit harder. So you have to go higher on your price and then come down low. So let's just say for argument six, we split the difference and we go in it like the 128 put. Okay. Okay. So we're going to sell one make that one contract, please, and make sure you're in the right account too. Should be account that ends in 81. Okay. Let's go up to the calls. Okay, stop. What call are you going to sell? Yeah. You might have to go up a little bit between like 177 and yeah, right around 177 ish. You notice the probability of being in the money there. What is that? 9%. 9%. It's almost double. That's skew. Meaning you can't get as much for the call as you can for the put. There's more fear to the downside. So those puts are bit higher, even though they're further away from the market. Makes sense? Okay. Let's, since I wanted to skew it a little bit to the downside, give ourselves a little bit of downside delta, let's take that call from 176 ish to 173. Does that work for you? Yeah. Now why pick 173? I really should pick 174 because it's wrapped around that 15% probability of being in the money. Keepers put a circle around that says 1611. So that would keep us outside of a one standard deviation. Exactly. Or right around a one standard deviation move. That's correct. Okay. So we're going further on the put, closer on the call, give ourselves a little bit more short delta. Just hold down the control key and click on the 174. That's fine. Keep muscles really honest. Okay. Now let's go on the call side. Let's go all the way down to define our risk because hit confirm and send one time on that trade. You use about 2200 hours worth of buying power. Not bad. But the way my account is right now. You're using almost 20,000 of a 30,000 dollar account. I want to see if we can tighten that up a little bit. So let's close that. And let's keep in mind that it's 22 dollars or 22 hundred dollars. So let's go up to the calls and see which call can we buy for a nickel or something like that. Okay, stop. It looks like a 84. Yeah, 184, 185. Okay. Let's just go 185 because we're going to have to go further on the call side. So we're $11 right now. Okay. So for five cents, we've built a, we're starting to build an iron condor that's $11 wide. That's going to use $1100 worth of buying power. Actually, $1,000 worth of buying power because you're collecting almost a dollar or the lower a dollar. Yeah. Instead of 2200. So we're cutting in half and paying a nickel. But we got to do something on the put side too. So let's go to the put side. Let's see if we can go 11 points lower and see what happens with selling the 128 put. Let's go to the one 17 put. Now look at the market on the one 17 put. Look at the market on all of those puts. So the 20 put, the 19 put, the 18 put, the 17 put. They're all basically the same price. Yeah. Right. And what we selling the 128 put for? The 128 we're selling for $50. Like $0.50. So if we've got to buy the other one for $0.25. We're selling that wide put spread for 25 cents. It doesn't make much sense. That's awesome. And the fact that you can realize that is really amazing. So just sell the call spread. Okay. So I did. So then it'll be. So if you're looking for short delta, I want to do both sides. I either have to go closer with my iron condor. Or I have to just sell the call spread. So then that keeps us with risk to the downside then. Nope. That keeps us with risk only to the upside in this position. You're selling a call spread. You're going to put or just you can hit customizing change it to zero or whatever. Didn't stand. You're only selling a call spread. Okay. Did I lose you? A little bit. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, we'll talk about it. It's good. I'm going to have to show us over. Let's take a let's just think about what we talked about here today. What I wanted to go over was your whole portfolio. You're long about 20 delta. I wanted to find something that would give you about 20 delta's worth of 20 short delta's. You're long 20 delta's in your portfolio.

Transcript:  I Think you're back Where do I start bang? Oh, so yeah, that's you that's your side. You can be like the dead fish hand did I yeah I apologize Speaking of dead fish how's your account doing today? It's a hundred and eighteen bucks operate on the day That's right, yeah, 120. Yeah, 127 I see up there you're still down about eighteen hundred bucks When we came on before we came on you like I'm not doing that great Don't look at your your P&L loss. I mean you have to be you know that's there. It's not going away You have to think about one brick at a time every day now to get there even faster than you're getting there You have to be cognizant of your Pricing Let's look at your canceled orders for a quick second here because you You rolled go all the way down the bottom All right, so you were gonna roll and open up your apple position So you have an apple September 110 straddle on and the stock Rallyed up to around one thirteen and change the other day. It came back down as what you needed You had some short dealt in there you were up a couple of dollars on the trade about Somewhere between ten twenty five bucks on the trade for the day and you wanted to roll from September to October Yeah, now let me look at your pricing here the first one you go in at a dollar fifteen Yeah, I say okay being a little bit aggressive You don't know what's gonna happen with the market next one you go in with it a dollar eight So you went from a dollar fifteen to a dollar eight so that just tells me that your pricing was really off from the very beginning Now let's go down a little and then you go down a one of five you don't get filled so now let me guess what was having to the stock The stock was starting to rally yeah, okay, so when the stock was going your direction and you were making some money back That's when you need to be aggressive with your pricing meaning like you got what you wanted don't think about what you might miss Do you know I'm trying you know I'm trying to say because hold on a second. Let's go to one oh five keep going One dollar canceled now. Let's go a little bit further one dollar cancel again. Let's go a little bit further. I know stop all right so You walked it from a dollar fifteen to a dollar Stock probably only moved about forty cents so You probably had a good chance to get filled at a buck oh five buck six buck four When the stock was moving in a direction like don't be a chaser try to do it into strength now We haven't since you've been on the show had that opportunity to roll into strength We've always been doing it from a defensive Play and that's the worst place to be like rolling to me As a reason why rolls a four four letter word it's like if you're rolling you're typically doing it as a defensive move And that's not a great Feeling and that's not a great thing, but when you have them your way be aggressive with your pricing because even if it continues going that way It works for you because you're not switching your position. You still wanted the stock to go down to 110 All right, so now let's look at what we did You tried to roll from September to October you went in a 380 credit So now what you're doing is you're just changing the September 110 straddle to the October 110 straddle I started looking for to roll it into a strangle That's why I did for for the dollar that the dollar credit you were moving the call up to the 115 call Yeah, I got it either one works, but since you couldn't get a dollar for the one you decided to get a little bit more credit for the other Okay, so you tried to roll for 380 keep going a 3.78 keep going 375 and then you got filled close that up for a minute And I got to tell the true story because we don't lie here on tasty trade open that up You got filled it a $3.72 credit, but what did you really go in at 370 370 so I wanted the fill all right, but because now you had to have it yeah yeah And you're moving it by nickels It cost you nothing to cancel and replace Move it by pennies you got filled at 370 to because the markets are tight and liquid and apple if that was a win or something else like that You might have been filled you know 20 25 cents off of what the mid price really should have been Now you asked me why do you get filled at 3.72? That's called price improvement That just means that the market is so competitive that even though you wanted to sell it at 370 Somebody said hold on here Sparky. I'll pay 3.72, which means there was probably a 3.73 bid somewhere That's nice that they helped dummy. That's that's great That is that worked in my favor. Yeah, they helped that that went in my favor this time and then to compound things You're selling five lots in GG when you're supposed to be trading that was a big bad fat finger because I wanted to sell a Naked putt in GG that was bat being in the wrong account That's true so you sold one putt in GG as a new trade open up the GG trade for a minute You're just selling a naked put using $280 worth of buying power you were thinking about doing a covered call And what I want what would I talk to you about was you know what? covered call lower probability of success than the Then the naked putt the naked covered call you can make more money Mm-hmm. Let's just call them both 65% probability of success 62% probability success They both have about the same probability of success Covered call has a little bit lower you can make more money The naked putt has a higher probability success you can make a little bit less I said let's not be that aggressive in GG. It's not something that we trade all the time. I don't even we don't have any gold exposure or You do have some mining exposure. So it's it's not a Correlated trade, but it's certainly stuff that you already have in your account unlike TLT which you put in there All right, so so naked putt Pretty classic trade. I think everybody can kind of understand it We always sell the strike that's basically one or two strikes out of the money in a low price stock like a 13 Half-dollar 13 dollar and six six and stock you're gonna be going one strike out of the money. Okay, perfect All good so now I have a question for you close up the cancel do orders and the field orders and GG Okay, you have another you have another Basically straddle on in Twitter now now I'm going to Twitter and we'll go to Monsanto in a minute But I want to go to Twitter open it up from it. You're up 30 bucks in here the stocks gone your direction It's gone to 28. That's what you wanted now you wished it had happened on expiration day and you were still in this trade Because this trade would be basically trading at around 30 cents each one of the options would be worth about 15 cents a piece at this time of the day Okay, but it's not it's it's 18 days worth of time left So why not while we're up in this stock and we got the move that we wanted why don't we try to do the same thing that you did in Apple But do it in Twitter why not like if it works in Apple? Why would you do in Twitter? Yeah, and I was actually thinking the same thing on Monsanto, but it's got earnings and a dividend in That kill you kill it for me kill this for you. Yeah, it's out of Monsanto Well, and now I was gonna trick you this is really good. Yeah, well, but I saw the same thing I mean Twitter moved in my direction this morning. It's up like a dollar 20 on the day or a dollar when I was looking at it And so I mean I was thinking that we would go To a strangle on the Twitter to go to move I agree Let's take a look. Let's go to the trade page But you're right Monsanto has earnings the following month so it just it just starts checking the boxes from for me to Want to close Monsanto at some time or stay in it more in September as opposed to going out to October earnings dividend I'd rather avoid them if I could make sense. Okay You can change the return on capital to position and you'll see that you're short the 28 straddle We're down about a hundred bucks on it. So when I look into become positive We got to first become even so we're looking to make back a dollar. That's what we're looking to do So let's see see if we can buy the 28 straddle That'll close out the trade that we have on and it'll hold down the control key and let's see what we can sell in October that's gonna give us around a $3 Well here, let me let me show you let's go to 26 call. Excuse me 26 put so now we're moving two strikes down and Let's go up to the 30 call Okay, so you can do that for a 19 cent debit now we like to do everything for a credit So I can move two strikes on either side and have about a 20 cent debit in the overall trade Here's where your market awareness. Here's where your opinion comes in We've been playing Twitter from the long side if you wanted to continue playing Twitter from the long side You would move up the October 26 put to the 27 put if you want and again It's only one strike. I mean, it's not like a humongous different Difference but it's that or move down the 30 call to the 29 strike or both Yeah, I was actually looking at the 27 I agree the 27 30 good In the worst case scenario, I could see myself light if If Twitter went below that 27 point I could see myself taking that Stock as shares. I mean and and just playing I'm playing some analysts that they liked it, but it's been it's been a pig. It's been terrible for the last Couple months, but yeah, this is a type of this is the type of adjustment Trade from strength. Mm-hmm Apple you were doing it from strength this you were doing it from strength others we've been doing from weakness I like this this makes sense to me. What am I trying to do? I'm trying to extend duration So I'm widening my sweet spot. I'm doing it for a credit I love for the credit to be a dollar 80 instead of 18 cents But I take what I can and I'm looking to make a dollar a full 100 bucks on this trade Okay, I think I think you do it. You want to go into an 18 cent credit? Now get a question for you Where do you want to route this order at what price? I mean if we're doing it into strength wouldn't we go a little bit above the mid price? Okay, so why? This is you run and right into your Apple bus saw that you had like I can see you're doing this at a 19 cent credit Seeing if you get filled the markets are two three cents wide But if you don't get filled at 19 you go put it at 18 you don't get filled at 18 you put it at 17 then you're done Yeah, let's put it in at 19 cents Hick and firm and send and send If we don't get filled there then we're gonna move it down to 18 cents and within a couple of seconds If you don't get filled there we'll move it down to 17 cents and hopefully we get filled there If we don't get filled 17 cents well, you'll have to move it down to 16 cents to get filled okay make sense Yeah, all right Well, you stole my thunder with no role in my and my Santos so What yeah, are we gonna I mean we're sticking to Monkley's because we could go weekly is if we Verde I mean like if we wanted to do that but I mean well the whole world is your oyster you can do anything you want You can trade e-liquid products if you want to start trading e-liquid products You could start trading oil futures that are a thousand dollars a point instead of a hundred dollars a point like a stock is I mean as a million things you can do or you can stick to the program The six-week expert that you are at this at this point and maybe You know what is it you got two years in one mouth listen twice as much as you speak I Got it. Let's take let's take a quick step back for a moment and talk about what we discussed today So we talked about a couple of things but really it's rolling and looking For your pricing on rolling especially when you're rolling into strength meaning when your positions making money for you You want to you want to be aggressive with your pricing like you want to be able to get filled because you're getting filled Not better because there's no substantive being getting filled better But you're getting filled because you want to be filled the stock is going in your direction So you're working with it at that time and at that time not letting it change not letting you chase it Okay, you start chasing it it makes it it makes it worse So we talked about rolling when we also talked about canceling and replacing Be aggressive with your canceling replacing it doesn't cost you anything to cancel replaces no ticket charge There's no commission so be aggressive with it You know what you want to go in a penny two or three above the mid price and you're watching the stock Okay, I get it But if you don't get filled start walking that order down until you do get filled and typically you get filled one or two cents around mid price All right, yeah, all right good job. I bet you I got a little Excited excited to get it on you were off by almost 20% we're gonna take a quick break who goes back now Tim night peace

Let's go to one oh five keep going One dollar canceled now. Let's go a little bit further one dollar cancel again. Let's go a little bit further. I know stop all right so You walked it from a dollar fifteen to a dollar Stock probably only moved about forty cents so You probably had a good chance to get filled at a buck oh five buck six buck four When the stock was moving in a direction like don't be a chaser try to do it into strength now We haven't since you've been on the show had that opportunity to roll into strength We've always been doing it from a defensive Play and that's the worst place to be like rolling to me As a reason why rolls a four four letter word it's like if you're rolling you're typically doing it as a defensive move And that's not a great Feeling and that's not a great thing, but when you have them your way be aggressive with your pricing because even if it continues going that way It works for you because you're not switching your position. You still wanted the stock to go down to 110 All right, so now let's look at what we did You tried to roll from September to October you went in a 380 credit So now what you're doing is you're just changing the September 110 straddle to the October 110 straddle I started looking for to roll it into a strangle That's why I did for for the dollar that the dollar credit you were moving the call up to the 115 call Yeah, I got it either one works, but since you couldn't get a dollar for the one you decided to get a little bit more credit for the other Okay, so you tried to roll for 380 keep going a 3.78 keep going 375 and then you got filled close that up for a minute And I got to tell the true story because we don't lie here on tasty trade open that up You got filled it a $3.72 credit, but what did you really go in at 370 370 so I wanted the fill all right, but because now you had to have it yeah yeah And you're moving it by nickels It cost you nothing to cancel and replace Move it by pennies you got filled at 370 to because the markets are tight and liquid and apple if that was a win or something else like that You might have been filled you know 20 25 cents off of what the mid price really should have been Now you asked me why do you get filled at 3.72? That's called price improvement That just means that the market is so competitive that even though you wanted to sell it at 370 Somebody said hold on here Sparky. I'll pay 3.72, which means there was probably a 3.73 bid somewhere That's nice that they helped dummy. That's that's great That is that worked in my favor. Yeah, they helped that that went in my favor this time and then to compound things You're selling five lots in GG when you're supposed to be trading that was a big bad fat finger because I wanted to sell a Naked putt in GG that was bat being in the wrong account That's true so you sold one putt in GG as a new trade open up the GG trade for a minute You're just selling a naked put using $280 worth of buying power you were thinking about doing a covered call And what I want what would I talk to you about was you know what? covered call lower probability of success than the Then the naked putt the naked covered call you can make more money Mm-hmm. Let's just call them both 65% probability of success 62% probability success They both have about the same probability of success Covered call has a little bit lower you can make more money The naked putt has a higher probability success you can make a little bit less I said let's not be that aggressive in GG. It's not something that we trade all the time. I don't even we don't have any gold exposure or You do have some mining exposure. So it's it's not a Correlated trade, but it's certainly stuff that you already have in your account unlike TLT which you put in there All right, so so naked putt Pretty classic trade. I think everybody can kind of understand it We always sell the strike that's basically one or two strikes out of the money in a low price stock like a 13 Half-dollar 13 dollar and six six and stock you're gonna be going one strike out of the money. Okay, perfect All good so now I have a question for you close up the cancel do orders and the field orders and GG Okay, you have another you have another Basically straddle on in Twitter now now I'm going to Twitter and we'll go to Monsanto in a minute But I want to go to Twitter open it up from it. You're up 30 bucks in here the stocks gone your direction It's gone to 28. That's what you wanted now you wished it had happened on expiration day and you were still in this trade Because this trade would be basically trading at around 30 cents each one of the options would be worth about 15 cents a piece at this time of the day Okay, but it's not it's it's 18 days worth of time left So why not while we're up in this stock and we got the move that we wanted why don't we try to do the same thing that you did in Apple But do it in Twitter why not like if it works in Apple? Why would you do in Twitter? Yeah, and I was actually thinking the same thing on Monsanto, but it's got earnings and a dividend in That kill you kill it for me kill this for you. Yeah, it's out of Monsanto Well, and now I was gonna trick you this is really good. Yeah, well, but I saw the same thing I mean Twitter moved in my direction this morning. It's up like a dollar 20 on the day or a dollar when I was looking at it And so I mean I was thinking that we would go To a strangle on the Twitter to go to move I agree Let's take a look. Let's go to the trade page But you're right Monsanto has earnings the following month so it just it just starts checking the boxes from for me to Want to close Monsanto at some time or stay in it more in September as opposed to going out to October earnings dividend I'd rather avoid them if I could make sense. Okay You can change the return on capital to position and you'll see that you're short the 28 straddle We're down about a hundred bucks on it. So when I look into become positive We got to first become even so we're looking to make back a dollar. That's what we're looking to do So let's see see if we can buy the 28 straddle That'll close out the trade that we have on and it'll hold down the control key and let's see what we can sell in October that's gonna give us around a $3 Well here, let me let me show you let's go to 26 call. Excuse me 26 put so now we're moving two strikes down and Let's go up to the 30 call Okay, so you can do that for a 19 cent debit now we like to do everything for a credit So I can move two strikes on either side and have about a 20 cent debit in the overall trade Here's where your market awareness. Here's where your opinion comes in We've been playing Twitter from the long side if you wanted to continue playing Twitter from the long side You would move up the October 26 put to the 27 put if you want and again It's only one strike. I mean, it's not like a humongous different Difference but it's that or move down the 30 call to the 29 strike or both Yeah, I was actually looking at the 27 I agree the 27 30 good In the worst case scenario, I could see myself light if If Twitter went below that 27 point I could see myself taking that Stock as shares. I mean and and just playing I'm playing some analysts that they liked it, but it's been it's been a pig. It's been terrible for the last Couple months, but yeah, this is a type of this is the type of adjustment Trade from strength. Mm-hmm Apple you were doing it from strength this you were doing it from strength others we've been doing from weakness I like this this makes sense to me. What am I trying to do? I'm trying to extend duration So I'm widening my sweet spot. I'm doing it for a credit I love for the credit to be a dollar 80 instead of 18 cents But I take what I can and I'm looking to make a dollar a full 100 bucks on this trade Okay, I think I think you do it. You want to go into an 18 cent credit? Now get a question for you Where do you want to route this order at what price? I mean if we're doing it into strength wouldn't we go a little bit above the mid price? Okay, so why? This is you run and right into your Apple bus saw that you had like I can see you're doing this at a 19 cent credit Seeing if you get filled the markets are two three cents wide But if you don't get filled at 19 you go put it at 18 you don't get filled at 18 you put it at 17 then you're done Yeah, let's put it in at 19 cents Hick and firm and send and send If we don't get filled there then we're gonna move it down to 18 cents and within a couple of seconds If you don't get filled there we'll move it down to 17 cents and hopefully we get filled there If we don't get filled 17 cents well, you'll have to move it down to 16 cents to get filled okay make sense Yeah, all right Well, you stole my thunder with no role in my and my Santos so What yeah, are we gonna I mean we're sticking to Monkley's because we could go weekly is if we Verde I mean like if we wanted to do that but I mean well the whole world is your oyster you can do anything you want You can trade e-liquid products if you want to start trading e-liquid products You could start trading oil futures that are a thousand dollars a point instead of a hundred dollars a point like a stock is I mean as a million things you can do or you can stick to the program The six-week expert that you are at this at this point and maybe You know what is it you got two years in one mouth listen twice as much as you speak I Got it. Let's take let's take a quick step back for a moment and talk about what we discussed today So we talked about a couple of things but really it's rolling and looking For your pricing on rolling especially when you're rolling into strength meaning when your positions making money for you You want to you want to be aggressive with your pricing like you want to be able to get filled because you're getting filled Not better because there's no substantive being getting filled better But you're getting filled because you want to be filled the stock is going in your direction So you're working with it at that time and at that time not letting it change not letting you chase it Okay, you start chasing it it makes it it makes it worse So we talked about rolling when we also talked about canceling and replacing Be aggressive with your canceling replacing it doesn't cost you anything to cancel replaces no ticket charge There's no commission so be aggressive with it You know what you want to go in a penny two or three above the mid price and you're watching the stock Okay, I get it But if you don't get filled start walking that order down until you do get filled and typically you get filled one or two cents around mid price All right, yeah, all right good job. I bet you I got a little Excited excited to get it on you were off by almost 20% we're gonna take a quick break who goes back now Tim night peace

Transcript:  I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna tell you a quick little story. We don't have a lot of times so hopefully we'll get everything but maybe I can make this day when the dow is down 400, you're down about $500 in your overall account and it seems like the products where we've used the most buying power. Those are the trades that you need to at least not hurt you the most and those are the ones that have hurt you the most. You can always look at your buying power reduction to figure out where your most risk is. Your most risk is in Apple. You have another one in it looks like Monsanto. Win is your largest loser to date. It's horrible. It's not fun. Not fun. Not fun. So let me tell you a story. Your father actually got to the floor of CBW in 1980. I started trading in 1983. Yeah, to be 21 years old to start trading. I also had to save $5,000. I didn't have $5,000 so it took me three years to save $5,000. In early in 1984, maybe the end of 1983, it was 1984 actually. Because I started just to have to Christmas because I had to get my Christmas bonus to actually make my $5,000. The dow was up $50 for the first time ever. It never happened before in history. And on that day I had an out trade. An out trade is just something. Everything's not electronic like it is today. I'd write something down on a card and then I would hand it to my clerk. She would go and check it with somebody else who I did the trade with and they would take that card upstairs and they would type it in and go through the system and eventually at the end of the day they'd all match up. Long story short, I made a trade with a guy who stood right next to me. We could talk to each other. I thought I did something. He thought he did something else and it basically busted me out. I was thinking it was the only time in my career when I didn't have any money in my account. So that day I traded with a small debit in my account and made a couple of dollars. I was under my limit of what I could trade with. The brokerage firm that I cleared through, the market making firm that I cleared through Branth Associates. Harry Brant was still alive but he was running the place then. He actually sold to first stop in Spear Leads Kellogg which ends up becoming Goldman Sachs. He allows me to trade with much less than the minimum that you needed which by the way the minimum was $5,000 at the time. And then I moved on with my career. So how did I move on with my career after being... You're down 2300 and $30,000 account. You're down $500 today. You've had a quick start. You were up around four, five hundred bucks and now you've been down as much as four thousand. But the reason I told you that story was you have to have number of occurrences. You gotta keep doing what you know will get you there. Now you may have to do different things, you may have to do things slightly differently. Like you're using $20,000 worth of buying power in your account of a $30,000 account. You can't ramp it up to $30,000 today. Now somebody would a larger account, let's say a $1,000 or $250,000 or a million dollars might be using 30, 40, 50% of their account, 60% of their account like you are, 66% of their account. They might ramp it up, be able to put on the same type of trades that they've always put on, strangles, straddles, more buying power trades than you can. So I told you this whole story because I wanted you to think about the type of trade that uses the least amount of buying power for a smaller size account that takes advantage of high implied volatility, which is the highest. Just go to a four-slush VX by the way. Volatility's moved 100% in the last week or so. There you go, 95% increase from around $15 to almost $30 in the last 10 days alone. That's a year move. That up there I think is a six-month or it's a year-to-date chart. That's a year move in volatility. It took a year from volatility to get from $30 to $15. It took one week to get from $15 to $30. So how do we take advantage of that using the least amount of buying power? What would be the type of strategy you would use? Iron condors? Sure. Sure. And the same way when I was trading back on the floor, I would have to close out all my positions at the end of the day because I didn't have any margin to keep trades overnight and not take advantage of any type of movement and overnight, which all the market makers were able to do, you're in the same type of situation. You've got to do strategies that don't use a lot of buying power. Iron condors would be the one. What stock would you like to do in iron condor? I was looking at Microsoft. Okay. What are the other end of the yields? And then I was looking at DIA. The diamonds, the diamonds, the markets are way too wide in there. Way too wide. I mean, they're 10 cents wide for the, here, since the diamonds are going to move the same way as PY, IW, I'm going to the Qs are going to move. I'd rather see you use one of those three than use the diamonds. Okay. Okay. And I know you already have positions in there, but maybe we can go in there too. Let's, since we have the charts up there, let's just go to Microsoft for a quick moment. I know Microsoft's gotten beaten up. It's down about 10% I think over the last 10 days or so. 11% trading $4195, okay, stocks down a buck and change. It looks like $1.50 or so. A little over 3% today. All right. What do you want to do in there? Let's go to Do. High implied volatility rank 89%. Yeah. The highest it's been for the year. Okay. I love it. I was looking at two of them. I had a $3 wide and a $2 wide. Let's, let's, let's since volatility is high. Let's go wider. I mean, you know, it's $300 worth of buying power. So if $3,000 worth of buying power with a, with a, with a strangler, something like that, you're going 45 days out. That's $5 with less change that to three. Okay. Click go. Now, most of our research is shown that a $3 wide iron condor is about the sweet spot for buying power reduction. I don't know if you stumbled on this or you knew this, but buying power reduction to risk versus reward. We like to collect around one third of the with the strikes. What strikes were you looking at? I was at, on the put side, I was at a 40 short and a 37 long. So the 40, 37 puts bread. Yep. And then on the call side, I was at the 46, 49. And it looks like it's right around 99 cents is the mid price. Okay. Listen, it's a 50, 50 shot. Yeah. So, so here, if we were doing a, a strangle using more buying power, we'd be able to go to the same distance that we normally would go and collect a higher premium. Or we'd be able to go further out and look to collect a dollar, we're like to collect around a dollar on the trade for about a, you know, 70% probably success on the trade. Here, you're able to go possibly a strike wider than you would have been able to go, you know, two weeks ago, a month ago, you know, two months ago, that's the advantage you have here. And the reason why we talk about this trade being good for a account that has limited amount of buying powers, you only have margin on one side. If you're selling the spread for a dollar for argument six, it's going to take $200 worth of buying power because the stock can't close over 49 at expiration and under 37. The brokerage from recognizes that. So your risk is only the $200. The $100 credit plus the width of the strikes being $3 total, $201. All right. I won it 99 cents and you can adjust this down by a penny or so. I wouldn't move it much more than that. Maybe two pennies at best if you want to get filled. I want you to have a number of occurrences on because I don't want you to be afraid to put on more trades. Okay. Can I come up with one? Yeah. Can I just come up with one in case you don't get filled in this? Can we talk about Microsoft for one second? Go back to that. Just click on undo so we can go back to what he had on. Okay. Perfect. Okay. So that's the strikes you had on. Let's take off that 37 put for a second. Now this is a Jade Lizard. We're selling a call spread. Selling the naked put. Your probably a success goes up by about 10 percent. Maybe a little bit less. You're collecting $1.52. Stock's been beaten up around 11 percent. Meaning, our research has shown when a stock has gone down around 10 percent in the last 10 days or less that typically you can get a little bit of a bounce up. Now I don't know if you get that in this market but that would be another consideration. So if you don't get, it's going to use about $600 worth of buying power instead of $200 worth of buying power. So because the stock is a cheaper price stock meaning it's only $40, not a hundred quarters. You're not using that much buying power. So if you don't get filled in the one, your decision, whichever one you pick, all you're doing is taking off that one side, giving yourself downside risk more than $200 downside risk of a couple of thousand theoretically but the U600 dollars worth of buying power. Let's look at IWM. You have a short call spread and IWM against basically one by two. Put spread and SPY and a naked short call and SPY. You're losing about, I'll just look here. We don't have to go to, you lose about $200 in SPY and you're making about $60 or so in IWM. Your overall account is leaning a little bit long about 60 delta's that 60 shares of SPY. We were short about 40 shares of SPY going into this move over the last couple of days. All right. Let's go to IWM, let's go to strategies. Let's do the same thing. Let's go to an iron condor. My buying power is no better than your buying power in your account. 45 days. I'm going to widen the strikes to five. So let's change the width from three to five. You can make it to, make it 60% probability of being in the money because that's about what you were maybe a little bit less. Click on go. All right. I gave you a little bit of your history on what your deltas were because I wanted you to think about what I'm going to do now. What I want to do is I want to sell a call spread right where it is, the one 16, 121. So that brings us about three and a half dollars away on the call side. Let's move our put side down further. Let's go to like 102, 97. So what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to get a little bit of, you did a completely neutral trade in Microsoft. If you just sell the naked put it would make a little bit more bullish. Here I'm skewing it to the downside a little bit to give myself a little bit room to the downside, but also to give me the short deltas that I think your account needs. Mid price at 224. That's the kind of trade I'd like to make. And I'd even high IV rank 67%. I would go into the diamonds too, just like you. But the diamonds just have, you know, too high. Yeah. I was looking at a $5 wide iron condor there as well for around the same credit. Look at better markets in here. Yeah. It gives you a little bit of short delta like it shows you at 13. You had about 60, we're reducing, you know, about 10% and 20%. Okay. Sound good? Yeah. All right, let's go into $2.23, which is the mid price. We get a little bit of a rally or probably get filled just because our call size is a little bit closer. All right. Let's take a quick second here just to think about what we discussed. We discussed a couple of things. What to do in buying power is an issue. You know, you don't have all the money when it's tied up in other products. Number of occurrences, like you have to, this is October with 45 days to go and high implied volatility. 45 days to go is the perfect time from our research to put on trades. But you know what, you limited by what you have and what you left with. The only other thing that I would have liked to have gotten to, which we didn't get a chance to, was win. We could talk about rolling down win, but we can do that tomorrow. Okay. All right. Yeah. You almost got a $20 loss in win. How we could make that only an $8 loss if things can work out a little bit with us. You know, a lot of the positions that you have on are exactly where they should be, meaning if it was expiration. In OIH, you're short to 29.31. 29 call, 31 call. The stock is right there at 30 and a half, right in between your short strikes. You're not making any money in that position. The volatility is just killing the prices. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. What do I normally say? That's good job.

You were up around four, five hundred bucks and now you've been down as much as four thousand. But the reason I told you that story was you have to have number of occurrences. You gotta keep doing what you know will get you there. Now you may have to do different things, you may have to do things slightly differently. Like you're using $20,000 worth of buying power in your account of a $30,000 account. You can't ramp it up to $30,000 today. Now somebody would a larger account, let's say a $1,000 or $250,000 or a million dollars might be using 30, 40, 50% of their account, 60% of their account like you are, 66% of their account. They might ramp it up, be able to put on the same type of trades that they've always put on, strangles, straddles, more buying power trades than you can. So I told you this whole story because I wanted you to think about the type of trade that uses the least amount of buying power for a smaller size account that takes advantage of high implied volatility, which is the highest. Just go to a four-slush VX by the way. Volatility's moved 100% in the last week or so. There you go, 95% increase from around $15 to almost $30 in the last 10 days alone. That's a year move. That up there I think is a six-month or it's a year-to-date chart. That's a year move in volatility. It took a year from volatility to get from $30 to $15. It took one week to get from $15 to $30. So how do we take advantage of that using the least amount of buying power? What would be the type of strategy you would use? Iron condors? Sure. Sure. And the same way when I was trading back on the floor, I would have to close out all my positions at the end of the day because I didn't have any margin to keep trades overnight and not take advantage of any type of movement and overnight, which all the market makers were able to do, you're in the same type of situation.

I'd rather see you use one of those three than use the diamonds. Okay. Okay. And I know you already have positions in there, but maybe we can go in there too. Let's, since we have the charts up there, let's just go to Microsoft for a quick moment. I know Microsoft's gotten beaten up. It's down about 10% I think over the last 10 days or so. 11% trading $4195, okay, stocks down a buck and change. It looks like $1.50 or so. A little over 3% today. All right. What do you want to do in there? Let's go to Do. High implied volatility rank 89%. Yeah. The highest it's been for the year. Okay. I love it. I was looking at two of them. I had a $3 wide and a $2 wide. Let's, let's, let's since volatility is high. Let's go wider. I mean, you know, it's $300 worth of buying power. So if $3,000 worth of buying power with a, with a, with a strangler, something like that, you're going 45 days out. That's $5 with less change that to three. Okay. Click go. Now, most of our research is shown that a $3 wide iron condor is about the sweet spot for buying power reduction. I don't know if you stumbled on this or you knew this, but buying power reduction to risk versus reward. We like to collect around one third of the with the strikes. What strikes were you looking at? I was at, on the put side, I was at a 40 short and a 37 long. So the 40, 37 puts bread. Yep. And then on the call side, I was at the 46, 49. And it looks like it's right around 99 cents is the mid price. Okay. Listen, it's a 50, 50 shot. Yeah. So, so here, if we were doing a, a strangle using more buying power, we'd be able to go to the same distance that we normally would go and collect a higher premium. Or we'd be able to go further out and look to collect a dollar, we're like to collect around a dollar on the trade for about a, you know, 70% probably success on the trade. Here, you're able to go possibly a strike wider than you would have been able to go, you know, two weeks ago, a month ago, you know, two months ago, that's the advantage you have here. And the reason why we talk about this trade being good for a account that has limited amount of buying powers, you only have margin on one side. If you're selling the spread for a dollar for argument six, it's going to take $200 worth of buying power because the stock can't close over 49 at expiration and under 37. The brokerage from recognizes that. So your risk is only the $200. The $100 credit plus the width of the strikes being $3 total, $201. All right. I won it 99 cents and you can adjust this down by a penny or so. I wouldn't move it much more than that. Maybe two pennies at best if you want to get filled. I want you to have a number of occurrences on because I don't want you to be afraid to put on more trades. Okay. Can I come up with one? Yeah. Can I just come up with one in case you don't get filled in this? Can we talk about Microsoft for one second? Go back to that. Just click on undo so we can go back to what he had on. Okay. Perfect. Okay. So that's the strikes you had on. Let's take off that 37 put for a second. Now this is a Jade Lizard. We're selling a call spread. Selling the naked put. Your probably a success goes up by about 10 percent. Maybe a little bit less. You're collecting $1.52. Stock's been beaten up around 11 percent. Meaning, our research has shown when a stock has gone down around 10 percent in the last 10 days or less that typically you can get a little bit of a bounce up. Now I don't know if you get that in this market but that would be another consideration. So if you don't get, it's going to use about $600 worth of buying power instead of $200 worth of buying power. So because the stock is a cheaper price stock meaning it's only $40, not a hundred quarters. You're not using that much buying power. So if you don't get filled in the one, your decision, whichever one you pick, all you're doing is taking off that one side, giving yourself downside risk more than $200 downside risk of a couple of thousand theoretically but the U600 dollars worth of buying power. Let's look at IWM. You have a short call spread and IWM against basically one by two. Put spread and SPY and a naked short call and SPY. You're losing about, I'll just look here. We don't have to go to, you lose about $200 in SPY and you're making about $60 or so in IWM. Your overall account is leaning a little bit long about 60 delta's that 60 shares of SPY. We were short about 40 shares of SPY going into this move over the last couple of days. All right. Let's go to IWM, let's go to strategies. Let's do the same thing. Let's go to an iron condor. My buying power is no better than your buying power in your account. 45 days. I'm going to widen the strikes to five. So let's change the width from three to five. You can make it to, make it 60% probability of being in the money because that's about what you were maybe a little bit less. Click on go. All right. I gave you a little bit of your history on what your deltas were because I wanted you to think about what I'm going to do now. What I want to do is I want to sell a call spread right where it is, the one 16, 121. So that brings us about three and a half dollars away on the call side. Let's move our put side down further. Let's go to like 102, 97. So what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to get a little bit of, you did a completely neutral trade in Microsoft. If you just sell the naked put it would make a little bit more bullish. Here I'm skewing it to the downside a little bit to give myself a little bit room to the downside, but also to give me the short deltas that I think your account needs. Mid price at 224. That's the kind of trade I'd like to make. And I'd even high IV rank 67%. I would go into the diamonds too, just like you. But the diamonds just have, you know, too high. Yeah. I was looking at a $5 wide iron condor there as well for around the same credit. Look at better markets in here. Yeah. It gives you a little bit of short delta like it shows you at 13. You had about 60, we're reducing, you know, about 10% and 20%. Okay. Sound good? Yeah. All right, let's go into $2.23, which is the mid price. We get a little bit of a rally or probably get filled just because our call size is a little bit closer. All right. Let's take a quick second here just to think about what we discussed. We discussed a couple of things. What to do in buying power is an issue. You know, you don't have all the money when it's tied up in other products. Number of occurrences, like you have to, this is October with 45 days to go and high implied volatility. 45 days to go is the perfect time from our research to put on trades. But you know what, you limited by what you have and what you left with. The only other thing that I would have liked to have gotten to, which we didn't get a chance to, was win. We could talk about rolling down win, but we can do that tomorrow. Okay. All right. Yeah. You almost got a $20 loss in win. How we could make that only an $8 loss if things can work out a little bit with us. You know, a lot of the positions that you have on are exactly where they should be, meaning if it was expiration. In OIH, you're short to 29.31. 29 call, 31 call. The stock is right there at 30 and a half, right in between your short strikes. You're not making any money in that position. The volatility is just killing the prices. Who comes up next? Tim Knight. What do I normally say? That's good job.

Transcript:  What do I start? Bat vs. bat. How are you? Good. About 600 bucks. I'm OK. It's been a good day for me. Better. Better day. Yes. Listen, you had to mark it down significantly yesterday twice as much or more than it is today that it's up and your account's doing better today than yesterday. That's nice. I'll tell you what's coming out. That's the difference. OK. Let's, I got a couple things I want to talk about. We did earlier on the show, we did a dynamic iron condor, which is a little bit different than what we've normally done. So I'd like to do one of those with you. I might even want to try to do it in the diamonds if we could. I know you mentioned the diamonds yesterday. I had mentioned diamonds a few days before that. We don't have a diamond position. It's the one we haven't been in yet. And we haven't been in yet. There aren't quite as liquid as PY and IWM, but as markets get a little bit slower, they get a little bit tighter. I think we can do something in their day. So I wanted to do that. I also wanted to look if you could put up as account for me, that'd be great. You just go to toss, it'd be fine. I also wanted to look at your wind trade, stocks down $35 since we put on this trade, you're down $1,000 total on it. I wanted to show you how we can roll down one more time and kind of like, and kind of be like giving up. It's my way of getting out of the trade and taking the loss. Still keeping a trade on, still keeping the risk. I wanted to do that. And then possibly discuss why open up the field orders. In SPY, we roll down our naked call against the one by two put spread that we have on. So I think just for ease of doing things, I think if we do the dynamic iron condor first, I think it's pretty self explanatory, we can get to that, we can even do that in Doh if you want to. And then we can go to the stuff that's a little bit more complicated. Is that cool? Is that cool? Okay, all right, let's do that. Let's go to Doh for a quick second and let's just put in DIA. Just for the sake of time, the diamonds have had the highest IV rank of all of the ETFs, not by a lot, by a little just about four or five percentage points, that also could just be because the markets are a little bit wider in there too. So it's as wide as everything else or as liquid and as strong as everything else, deep and liquid meaning the markets are. IV rank of 59 has been coming down from around 60 to 70, it's down to 59 now. Dynamic iron condor is the short strikes, both at a 20% probability of being in the money and your long strikes that define your risk are at a 10%. Okay. So it's as simple as that. However the volatility skew is, if there's more skew in the puts, then your puts bread would be wider or tighter, do you think? If there's more, it'd be wider. You'd have to make it wider to get that credit, that credit, right? No, it just has to do with how, since the expectation of a move is so much greater to the downside, then that 10% probability is going to be further away. Let's do it and let's take a look. Okay. It might be easy if we just go to the table view and let's go to October. And we just stay in the monthly options, we don't trade the weekly options, we'll use delta here, delta probability being in the money is pretty much the same. You can stop right there for a moment. Do you see on the right hand side there on the put side, what put has about a 20 delta? Looking at 149. 148, either one of them, 1918, let's just go to the 148 for right now. Okay. Okay, let's click on selling the 148 and which one has a 10 delta of around? The 141. The 138. Yeah, 138, 137. All right there. Let's just go to the 138 and I'm skewing it a little bit just because probably even the money is going to be a little bit higher than the delta because probably even the money factors in the option being worth at least a penny. Okay. And on toss you'll see that these numbers kind of match up pretty close to what I'm talking about. 20% probably being the money, 10%. All right, let's look at the call side. The call side, we're looking at around what strike for that 20 delta? Between, I mean 71, 72. Let's go to 71, you're perfectly right. Sell the 71. And for the 10%. We're going to go to the 175. Exactly, let's go to 175. So you're looking at a $4 wide call spread. You see that, 171, 174 versus a 138, 148. It's $10 wide. It's $10 wide, so it's twice as wide on the downside than it is on the upside. But yet, both of them, both short options, which is your biggest concern, have a 20% probability of being in the money. That's skew. Okay. That's nice. This is trading for, it looks like about $1.79 that's been the mid price pretty much all day. You can notice the market's a little bit wide in there. 171, 187, 171 being the natural bid. 189 or so being the natural. So it's going to $1.80 and let's move it down as much as two to three cents and no more. Okay. After the show is over, just so we can do the rest of the show. We're going at 180 and see what happens. Okay. Okay. If I'll tell you the upticks a little bit or the market rally is a little bit, maybe you get filled. All right. Okay. Just outside our one third, the width. Idea. Different. Yes. Because it's not equal. It's not equal with on both sides, $3, $3. We collect $1, $1.13. Does it call the dynamic iron condor? Well, something different. Okay. Do you look for like a specific percentage of credit to get on these? Like is it compared to the, to the biggest side or the smallest side of the lake? It's really wrapped around Dave's tolle exploration, which is right around 45, which is the perfect time. Okay. All right. Yeah. Okay. Cool. So we hopefully will have another trade on. We'll put on the diamonds. Okay. So we'll go to the account statement tab if you wouldn't mind. And put in a win, please, W-Y-N-N. Pig. Pig, right. We started on 810 when the stock was trading at around 105. 105. It's exactly right. The stock is $72 or just under $71.81. I bought it there. I'd be down a lot more. Yeah. Well, so you got to think about that. I don't know if you're going to have a financial position, but there's somebody that bought it. There's somebody that sold it. There's somebody that's bought it and sold it for a loss. There's somebody that sold it and bought it for a profit or a scratch or everything's in between there. But what I want to show you is how we can kind of limit the loss that we have. Remember, how is short put was 90? All things being equal with the stock at, you know, 80. We've had a really fight. Remember the stock was 105. Yeah. Okay. When we get out of this trade, go to the trade page for a moment. How can we get out of this trade but without getting out of it? I want to get out at a better price. You're down about $1,000 on this trade. Let's see how we can get out at a better price. Now, what I should have showed you a moment ago, all of those roll downs, the mechanical rolling of the untested side, has brought in a credit of around $9.23, $0.25, something like that. It's called $9.25. If we roll down a little bit further and go what we call inverted, meaning our call is going to be in the money and our put is already in the money. If the stock lands in between there, somebody is going to put stock to us and we're going to sell stock to somebody else at expiration, we would have nothing. If both strikes are in the money, do you got me so far? Yeah. Okay. One's going to give me a hundred long dollars. That's where we've been at, though. We've reverted now when it changed return on capital to positions. You're inverted, but you're not, you're not, both strikes are not in the money. Stop right there. You're 78 call, although it is below your 90 put, your 90 put is in the money. You're still out of the money. So just here to where the stock is right now. Exactly. So if the stock were to expire here, you would come in long 100 shares of stock and you'd have to do something. In October, you could sell a call. I mean, there's a million things you can do about it where you can roll it. Today, a million things you can do about it. One's been kind of a, you know, the used to be a stock called was still around. Shield, Sears, SHLD. I can never make money of it. I just could, it was just, it had my number. You know, it was like, it was like when I was a kid, Mitchell and Cavaya could beat me up. He always beat me up. Nothing I do. Now Vivian, my next or neighbor, used to go and beat up Mitchell for me, but I couldn't beat up Mitchell. He even just had my number. I have nothing I could do about it. Same thing here. The win has just gotten that number. It's not really the most liquid stock and I don't want to go into it into perpetuity. And I was looking at the puts today even to roll them and it was like, if I wanted to roll down, this roll to the next, to the next expiration was like an 87 cent credit. It would give me years to get, to get to even on that. Or price movement. One day, yeah, or huge price movement. One day this stock is going to be up $10. We probably won't have a position. I want to add, but one day this actually would be up $10. So what I was suggesting that we do is we roll down to the 70, 78 call spread. So we sell the 70 call and we buy the 78 call. So we're selling out a new call, buying our 78 call back, not using any more buying power. It looks like it's only around $3.29 earlier today. It was around $3.40 when the stock was a little bit higher. Let's go in at $3.35. And maybe if the market continues to rally and this rally is a little bit, you can always move it down a little bit more. We'd have a total credit of around $12.50. And let's call it. And you would have a $20 inverted spread. 70 to 90 is $20. You collected $12.50. So it's an 800 loss. $750. You're down a thousand. You pick up, you don't pick up $250. You get $250 back. As opposed to just closing the position today. I mean, could the stock go below 70? Absolutely. Do you still have risk for the next two weeks? Absolutely. But for that risk, you've got a possible profit, possibly getting back $250. And it wouldn't even matter how far up the stock goes. That has to stay in between 70 and 90. Yeah, but if it's 71 or 89, it's not not a loss. That's going to be $800. That's correct. Or the $750. That's correct. It's tough. Pilled the swallow. Tough Pilled the swallow. You were down around $1400. You're down a thousand. You give up the directional risk. You know, if the stock were rally back to 78, you know, you could almost be breaking even on this trade. If I didn't make this move. That's correct. Let's beta weight your overall position. And we ran out of time and I didn't even get to what I really wanted to get to. Let's beta weight. Let's go to his monitor tip. You could send it. Do you want to send that? Go into 340. And so to give you some time to think about it. Yeah. Okay. Hey, confirm and send it. It's entirely up to you. I want it to be your trade. Cool. Let's go to the account statement tip for a moment. Beta weight is overall position to SPY. And we did roll down a little bit in SPY. So that took off the 28 long deltas that you have in SPY. They were around 45. Rolling down into strength. And then we can go over the one by two what it looks like. You have 38 long deltas. We really should be have short delta in this portfolio because you have positive theta. So we still got things to do. If you roll down your win, you'll pick up another 20 short deltas. That'll help you a little bit. All right. One last thing and it was everything that I wanted to talk about today. Let's go to his account statement tab. He put in SPY. You did a trade in October, just an October trade just a few days ago that I earned conduits. You see that 827 there? A $2.25 St. Credit. It's trading for around $1.60. We've done a market measure and a research about should I stay or should I go is what it's called. And it explains on a strangle how much percentage you should make and whether you should close a trade or keep the trade because everybody always asks I know how to get into a trade. How do I get out of a trade? This is not a strangle. It's an iron condor but it was very, very wide. $10 wide, very, very far out of the money. It's trading for around $1.60. You're up a little over 30%. After five days. After five days, five, six days. That's something that you would consider getting out of it. It's a bell. It was a strangle. I would tell you to get out of it. This is a synthetic strangle. I think you might consider taking a profit. I see diminishing return on capital at this point. When you hit 30% in five days. You got to profit. Maybe it's time to take it. Let's just go back and see what we discussed. We discussed a lot today. I really wanted to talk more about what I just touched on a moment ago and that's when to close a strangle. We did an excellent market measure. I hope they put up the slide if they could. There it is right there. Should I stay or should I go from July 30th, 2014, which explains, you should watch it in its entirety. You should watch it too. It's a market measure just telling you when you should get out of strangles, what percentage of profits compared to the days that it's held. You'll notice six days. You've got around a 25%, 28%. I can't remember exactly what your profit is. By this measure, you probably should take off that trade. We also talked about our SPY trade and we looked at the dynamic iron condor. A lot of stuff we did today. I hope you go back and watch that last market measure that we did and I enjoyed your company today. That was great. Who comes up next? Hi, Bees reporting.

Well, so you got to think about that. I don't know if you're going to have a financial position, but there's somebody that bought it. There's somebody that sold it.

We've reverted now when it changed return on capital to positions. You're inverted, but you're not, you're not, both strikes are not in the money. Stop right there. You're 78 call, although it is below your 90 put, your 90 put is in the money. You're still out of the money. So just here to where the stock is right now. Exactly. So if the stock were to expire here, you would come in long 100 shares of stock and you'd have to do something. In October, you could sell a call. I mean, there's a million things you can do about it where you can roll it. Today, a million things you can do about it. One's been kind of a, you know, the used to be a stock called was still around. Shield, Sears, SHLD. I can never make money of it. I just could, it was just, it had my number. You know, it was like, it was like when I was a kid, Mitchell and Cavaya could beat me up. He always beat me up. Nothing I do. Now Vivian, my next or neighbor, used to go and beat up Mitchell for me, but I couldn't beat up Mitchell. He even just had my number. I have nothing I could do about it. Same thing here. The win has just gotten that number. It's not really the most liquid stock and I don't want to go into it into perpetuity. And I was looking at the puts today even to roll them and it was like, if I wanted to roll down, this roll to the next, to the next expiration was like an 87 cent credit. It would give me years to get, to get to even on that. Or price movement. One day, yeah, or huge price movement. One day this stock is going to be up $10. We probably won't have a position. I want to add, but one day this actually would be up $10. So what I was suggesting that we do is we roll down to the 70, 78 call spread. So we sell the 70 call and we buy the 78 call. So we're selling out a new call, buying our 78 call back, not using any more buying power. It looks like it's only around $3.29 earlier today. It was around $3.40 when the stock was a little bit higher. Let's go in at $3.35. And maybe if the market continues to rally and this rally is a little bit, you can always move it down a little bit more. We'd have a total credit of around $12.50. And let's call it. And you would have a $20 inverted spread. 70 to 90 is $20. You collected $12.50. So it's an 800 loss. $750. You're down a thousand. You pick up, you don't pick up $250. You get $250 back. As opposed to just closing the position today. I mean, could the stock go below 70? Absolutely. Do you still have risk for the next two weeks? Absolutely. But for that risk, you've got a possible profit, possibly getting back $250. And it wouldn't even matter how far up the stock goes. That has to stay in between 70 and 90. Yeah, but if it's 71 or 89, it's not not a loss. That's going to be $800. That's correct. Or the $750. That's correct. It's tough. Pilled the swallow. Tough Pilled the swallow. You were down around $1400. You're down a thousand. You give up the directional risk. You know, if the stock were rally back to 78, you know, you could almost be breaking even on this trade. If I didn't make this move. That's correct. Let's beta weight your overall position. And we ran out of time and I didn't even get to what I really wanted to get to. Let's beta weight. Let's go to his monitor tip. You could send it. Do you want to send that? Go into 340. And so to give you some time to think about it. Yeah. Okay. Hey, confirm and send it. It's entirely up to you. I want it to be your trade. Cool. Let's go to the account statement tip for a moment. Beta weight is overall position to SPY. And we did roll down a little bit in SPY. So that took off the 28 long deltas that you have in SPY. They were around 45. Rolling down into strength. And then we can go over the one by two what it looks like. You have 38 long deltas. We really should be have short delta in this portfolio because you have positive theta. So we still got things to do. If you roll down your win, you'll pick up another 20 short deltas. That'll help you a little bit. All right. One last thing and it was everything that I wanted to talk about today. Let's go to his account statement tab. He put in SPY. You did a trade in October, just an October trade just a few days ago that I earned conduits. You see that 827 there? A $2.25 St. Credit. It's trading for around $1.60. We've done a market measure and a research about should I stay or should I go is what it's called. And it explains on a strangle how much percentage you should make and whether you should close a trade or keep the trade because everybody always asks I know how to get into a trade. How do I get out of a trade? This is not a strangle. It's an iron condor but it was very, very wide. $10 wide, very, very far out of the money. It's trading for around $1.60. You're up a little over 30%. After five days. After five days, five, six days. That's something that you would consider getting out of it. It's a bell. It was a strangle. I would tell you to get out of it. This is a synthetic strangle. I think you might consider taking a profit. I see diminishing return on capital at this point. When you hit 30% in five days. You got to profit. Maybe it's time to take it. Let's just go back and see what we discussed. We discussed a lot today. I really wanted to talk more about what I just touched on a moment ago and that's when to close a strangle. We did an excellent market measure. I hope they put up the slide if they could. There it is right there. Should I stay or should I go from July 30th, 2014, which explains, you should watch it in its entirety. You should watch it too. It's a market measure just telling you when you should get out of strangles, what percentage of profits compared to the days that it's held. You'll notice six days. You've got around a 25%, 28%. I can't remember exactly what your profit is. By this measure, you probably should take off that trade. We also talked about our SPY trade and we looked at the dynamic iron condor. A lot of stuff we did today. I hope you go back and watch that last market measure that we did and I enjoyed your company today. That was great. Who comes up next? Hi, peace.
