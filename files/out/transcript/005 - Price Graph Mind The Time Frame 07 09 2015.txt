 Can we Nikki we're back where do I start? back to back how are you good I was your night last night um it was good. It was tough I had I had some tough homework and I Couldn't figure out where was your homework? My homework was to get a a stock that I was bullish on and a stock that I was bearish on. 15,000 stocks to choose from. We have software that basically does most of the work for you. I gave you the criteria and set up and you had a hard time finding a couple of stocks. It was. It was. I mean, their earnings time is coming up. So it was really hard for me to find one that didn't have earnings within the next 45 days. That was really the hardest thing to find. The IVR stocks. I mean, I was able to find those, but something that didn't have any. Hi, IVR. High implied volatility rank that we always look for. Yeah. Good. So, especially one that I was had bullish or bearish idea on. I found one for bullish. So you're a permable. I'm a permable. Really? Okay. Well, maybe we didn't know it. Maybe we didn't know it, but we call this bad versus bad for other reasons, but maybe it's because I'm typically a permabar or at least when markets are at all time highs, which they are now. I'm typically a lot more bearish than when markets are at lows or have made a big move down. Then I kind of get bullish. I kind of go both ways, but I'm really a permabar more than anything else. I love to sell. If I've got my palms out and I'm selling is what I'm most comfortable. But you're thinking that you're a permable. How many trades have you made in your entire life? Zero. How do you know what you are? I haven't picked a side yet. No, no, no, it's good. I don't want you to pick a side. I mean, truth be told, again, on the show that we do all day for almost five hours a day, markets have been going up for the most part. So I'm a contrarian. I like to sell when everybody wants to buy. I like to buy when everybody else likes to sell. So what I want to do here and throughout the show is I want to stay as neutral as possible and make you grow to your own comfort just so that everybody out there can grow to their own comfort. But you also have to have some sort of market assumptions. So to say that you're a bullish trader, quote unquote, bulls trader, or even a bearish trader is way too early when you haven't made a trade. So you have no idea what you are or what you're going to become or how you're going to like to trade. You know, everybody develops a different style. Tom Saasnoff and myself have worked together for almost 30 years doing the same type of business, same type of trades. We're typically on the same sides of the market. But I might do a different strategy than he does. I don't want to risk as much capital as he does. I want to risk more capital as he does. I'd rather have a higher probability of success trade than a 50-50 shot trade that he might put on. So that's what happens in a civil partnership. Watch our show. It's not so civil sometimes. But yes, okay. So you had a homework assignment. I digress. You had a homework assignment. We were looking for a bullish stock and a bearish stock. What did you come up with? And how did you come up with the process? So the stock that I chose to be bullish on was Baba. Okay. And the reason I picked that was that, I mean, it's relatively... Could have shot up a Baba if you don't mind. You don't have to. Nick, let's have the team do it for a moment. Good. It's at a relative low point. I think it was about $4 or $5 above its lowest point that it's been at. And you know, it obviously was one of those stocks that opened and was kind of on fire when it came out. And so... This is a 52 week chart above. And again, it's just for demonstration purposes. I don't look any technicals or if there's more green or more red or anything else like that. I just look at it for price. So I'm going to look at it like a new trader like you. So you said it's relatively at a low price. What time frame did you look at? Well, the 52 weeks. I mean, since... Well, that's 52 weeks. But how do you judge something as high low? So here's what I'm saying. Baba's not the greatest example. But if you were to tell me, you should say that Baba's at an all-time low. Because for 52 weeks, it really hasn't been any lower. Yeah, it's a lot of... So it's not relatively low. It's at an all-time low. But it only has four months worth of data. If we were looking at another stock like Apple or something like that, put a Apple for a moment. And again, I just like to go to Apple because it's widely held and people understand what the stock is. So here in Apple, if I were to show you a 52 week graph of Apple, you would say, high end low end, which end? High end. High end. Now let's change that graph to a 30-day graph. Okay, now is it at the high end or a low end? Low end. Okay, so how can a stock be at the high end or the low end? My point that I'm making here, just bear with me for a moment. Because we're trying to learn. We love the pushback. I think the audience wants you to push back. And I want you to push back. Because this is the only way that you're going to be able to learn or at least not even learn. That's a bad term. It's the only way that you're going to get to formulate your own opinion is if you have something else to look at, besides your own opinion. Because your own opinion is very public and new. You've never made your first trade. So give me a benefit of the doubt for a moment. And let's look here. So let's talk about the stock at the high end of its range and the low end of its range at the same time. This is why I hate to look at charts for anything other than price. And price for where something's been. Now for me, when I'm- And price change, yeah, like day to day, you brought a Baba. I don't trade Baba a lot, but it's been in the news, so I kind of know where it's been and where it's going. That other stock that you mentioned yesterday, PRAA. PRAA. If I didn't see a chart of PRAA, I would have no idea where it's been or where it's going. That doesn't where it's been and where it is. That has no bearing on where it's going to go. The only thing I can judge it by, where the things that I gave you yesterday, and we'll recap them in a minute. Okay, so we just prove that looking, you know, depends on what time frame you look at. It gives you what your opinion is on high end to low end. So I got to throw that out. Like I can't use that. Now we're going to live in a 40- Well, what, well, you tell me. I told you when we were going to open a trade, what was the optimal time? Like how much time till expiration do we typically look at? Do you remember? Yeah, it was 40 to 45 days. Around 45 days. Okay, so to give myself a little bit of room, three to six months, that's about as much time as I'm going to look at it as stock. Does that make sense? If you're going to look at a graph. If I'm going to look at a graph just to get a view. So let's just keep the 52 week the way we have it. But really, I'm only going to look at the last six months or so. And you've got, was it, have it July, August September? That has a full year, right? Is that a full year? Yeah, 52 weeks. Okay, so I'm only going to look at like the last half of the graph. Does that make sense? So if I was looking at Apple, I would say to myself, you know what, Apple's what? In the last six months, the red box. I mean, in the middle. Yeah, it's mid range. Okay, so then I'd have to look at the applied volatility. The applied volatility is IV rank. 51. Yeah, 51 up on top there. You could put a circle around the feet if you don't mind. Or it arrows perfect. All right, 51%. But we know that Apple has earnings coming. So Apple gets thrown out. And we can't make the tread. We can even pull up the six month IVR that Doe uses as well. You could. On there. I mean, if it sure is there a correlation there? I mean, if you're looking at six months worth of stock movement, is a six month IVR, something that you would. It is. And I have no problem using it as long as you do it all the time. Okay. Okay, so like, like I have no problem with you looking at a one month. I have a one month IVR. I don't think it's enough time. But as long as you use it all the time, stay consistent. Then I'm okay with it. I like 52 weeks. Some people argue that that six months is better. It's all your personal preference. Makes sense? Yeah. Okay, short a period of time gives you a little bit less of a, gives you more of a, like we just looked at the stock a moment ago. From one year, gave you a lot of data points on the chart. Six months gave you a little bit less. One, one week, a one month is going to give you a lot less. And I think six months is kind of like a happy medium. So if you were doing like a longer term trade, if you put on a trade that's, let's say, has 120 days or 110 days, would you use? Stop. What's your optimal time to put on a trade? 40 to 45 days. So why are we going to talk about something we're never going to do? It's true. Makes sense? Mm-hmm. Okay, so give me one of the stocks that you said you couldn't find. I couldn't find. I couldn't find. So I'm a little bit upset. So I'd have to, like, remember, yes that we talked about sitting you out of a football game. Yeah. How many games a year? Well, I was never good at football. Hold on a sec. I never did that. Well, you graduated in four years. So you must have done something well in college. Yeah. So we only played around 10 football games a year, eight to 10 football games. Something like that. And you had to sit out one because you didn't do one of your homework assignments or get something done right. So the first day, you didn't do your homework. 15,000 stocks. I showed you exactly what, okay. I couldn't find a stock stock. I had an ETF that I... Okay. We'll live with that. It's like doing your homework but not really. Yeah, like halfway. Like halfway. So what were you bullish on? So I was bullish on IWM. IWM, you were bullish. Can I ask why? It doesn't matter because there's no reason. Same thing with taking a look at the chart and just deciding that, you know, it was in the last year, it's at a high point. And... So you think it's gonna go higher? No, to go bearish is go down. Oh, bearish. Oh, it was your bearish play. I thought you said bullish. Oh, I apologize. I mean, bullish was, was, was Boba. Oh, your bullish was Boba and your bearish was IWM. Yeah. You know what? I don't mind it so much as, you see, I'm, I'm a contrarian, right? So you got Boba on the low end. You've got IWM on the high end. For me, that fits. Now, that's not the reason why I would want you to make the trade or not. But it fits my logic. Like, to me, I'm selling something that's high. I'm not selling the low. And I'm buying something that's low. I'm not buying the high. Yeah. Most public does it exactly the opposite, the same way that you walked into this room. The insurance idea was that it's, you know, if you have a stock at $100, you, you know, you want to buy that insurance so that if it goes down, you hedge that loss. 100%. Yeah. So my goal on the show was, when we did, when we did back to cool with Katie, last person I did the show with, we had somebody else doing most of the trades for us, meaning they would run that we call the driver and make the trades. My goal with you is I want to watch you as a, as a new trader stumble along on the platform, make the mistakes so that you can learn how to use the platform really, really well. So you said, and we're running out of time, you said that you were long, want to be long on Bob and short on IWM. Okay. So tomorrow, first thing, as soon as we get in here, that's the trades that you're going to make. And I'll show you how you're going to make them. Let's try to, let's try to wrap up everything that we, that we just learned here or we have learned over the last couple of days. And I've got another homework assignment for you. All right, so the first thing that we were looking at, we really didn't get to it with selling premium. I want you to sell premium. And if you're bullish on Bob, I want you to sell a put. And if you're bearish on IWM, I want you to sell a call. The things that we look at are liquidity. You certainly can go back to best practices and that's your homework from 217.15 and everybody out there can do it. And just watch that 15-minute segment on liquidity. There are others and there might even be others that are better than that. But at least you can find one you can understand a little bit more about liquidity and how you can find stocks instead of stumbling on them. No earnings was something that we looked at. Did you look at when Bob had earnings? I didn't, I mean, I didn't see that it was, I don't think it's within 40 days. Okay, we don't, we don't think. We know. So you have to check if Bob has earnings. Does IWM have earnings? ETFs don't, ETFs, I don't want to, I'm not here to trick you. ETFs don't have earnings. So IWM, SPY, any ETF doesn't have earnings. So you don't have to worry about that. So when earnings season's coming along, you might want to lean towards and look for trades in an ETF. High IV rank, does Bob have a high IV rank? Yeah. Okay, so you're good there. But you got to check for earnings because I think earnings are coming up. 45 days to open is a market measure from 117.14 and there are others that you can look at for our criteria on opening trades. All right. Tomorrow's Friday, let's get a trade done. You're going to make your first trade tomorrow for sure in those two stocks. You're going to be selling IWM, you're going to be buying Boba. Who comes up next? Tim Knight? What do we say? Peace.engois horizon of policy exchanges.
