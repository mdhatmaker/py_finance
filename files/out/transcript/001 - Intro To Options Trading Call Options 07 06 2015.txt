 I'm gonna be back. Nicky, we're back, first show. Where do I start? Bat versus bat. Big bat, little bat. You want a Maddie? This can be a great thing. It's gonna be fun. So, first show. I thought about it all weekend. I know you talked with me about it. You're a little nervous and apprehensive on what we're gonna talk about on this show. I'm gonna take it really, really slow. Begin a trader. I know that you've been talking to other people out there on the dope platform and different ways of looking at things and what you should be trading. I know you've been doing some paper trading and fake type trading. Which puts you in a good place. Because that's what people who are watching this show today. That's kind of in the same spot that they're in. Meaning that they've gotten some sort of instruction from somewhere they've took it on their own to paper trade. I want to show you what I look at. Now, I've been trading for about 35 years. Been in the business. I remember when I bought my CBOE seat in 1987 and I thought to myself, you know, there's always gonna be a bat on the floor of the CBOE to trade. It's like a dream. I mean, I never thought something like that would come true. And now, with the way things have developed, no more floor trading or anything like that, I thought, you know, having my son in the family business would never come to fruition. But here you are, which makes me extremely, extremely proud and happy to have you on the show with me. So thank you for, thank you for doing so. Are you graduating college? Tell everybody a little bit about yourself. I graduated college on 2012. I studied economics. Went into the finance industry. I worked for a debt buyer. It was an interesting business. I mean, it was my first one right out of college. So I was kind of, you know, thrown into the fire kind of thing. And, you know, after a couple of years, I decided I needed a change. And, you know, why not join my debt trading? And see what's, what his business is about. Fantastic. So, with school and with, you know, your first job out of school, it all comes down to me trading. When I first started trading, like this week, I try to reflect on, you know, my own first trading experiences. When I first started trading, I only traded one or two options of all the options that were there. I only traded one or two options. I tried to learn those one or two options, how they were moving, their normal price range, how they were quoted. Everything about those one or two options. And that's kind of what I want you to, to focus on today. And those one or two options is not just one option in an option series, but calls and puts. Now, a call is usually the first thing that most people will trade when they're looking at options. A call is just the right, but not the obligation to do something. Let's put up the dough platform for a second. And you can see it right across on the screen there. We'll put up the dough platform and we'll just look at calls and puts. It's a very simple stuff. Here's Monsanto, a stock. We can look at an ETF. Let's go into SPY as opposed to an individual stock. Or would you prefer, would you prefer going to something that you might be more familiar with, like Apple or something like that? Yeah, we could go into an Apple. Okay, let's look at an Apple before we get to an ETF. I think Apple's a good stock to use as a, and you can close up the strikes or make them smaller. What's the difference between an ETF and an ETF? What is... Okay, so that's a great question. An ETF is just a basket of stocks. So if somebody was to say something like a, they wanted to buy a mutual fund, they're buying a basket of stocks. If that mutual fund is supposed to mirror the S&P 500, it's supposed to mirror SPY. SPY is an ETF. It's a basket of stocks. It's the S&P 500. It's the 500 most capitalized stocks. So, asking me to name all 500? I can't. But then a movement in one of those underlying doesn't affect, or I mean it affects the overall, but they're altogether. So some go up, some go down, and you know, the overall movement of the ETF is a combination of all of those movements happening. So correct. So I think what you're trying to say is an ETF you would suspect, and probably true in most cases, has diversification. Monsanto is just going to be in its field. Apple is just about Apple stock. Now, if the NASDAQ's going higher, Apple makes a big part of the NASDAQ. If the NASDAQ's going higher, Apple's probably going higher. If Apple's going higher, the NASDAQ's probably going higher. SPY, standing in force 500, we were looking at a moment ago, is a 500 different stock. So yes, some will go up, some will go down. But that's what every fund manager, or almost fund managers, are caged against, meaning if the S&P goes up 5% this year, they're looking how did they do, how did their fund do against the S&P 500? Okay. All right. So we're going to look at Apple, and we're going to stock 125 dollars. Keep it a circle around Apple stock. Thank you. All right. So if I want to buy one share of Apple, I would need $125.54 plus commissions and everything else. So about a, let's just call it $130 to buy one share of Apple. Now, you're 25 years old. $130 might mean one thing to you. Might mean one thing, a different thing to me. And it might mean something else to another 25 year old. But for the way I trade and the way they'd hope that you'll trade, $125.13 is a reasonable amount of money to put into something. Now, if you would have buy one share of Apple, assuming if I bought a share of Apple, I'm assuming the stock is going to go higher. Yeah, you want the stock to go higher. It's a 50-50 shot in our eyes. You can argue that it's a 53-47 that stocks have a natural drift to the upside. Our research shows it's about 3%. So if you were to buy Apple, be a 53% shot your way versus a 47% if you were to sell it. Okay. $125. Apple goes up $10. It goes from $125 to $135. You make $10. Great. Well, great. Yeah, but not a... Let's take a look at... Go to a chart of Apple for a quick second. Apple hasn't had a $10 move in the last... It looks like, well, all of February, March, April, May, and June, it looks like it hasn't had a... It has just about a $10 move if you bought the bottom and sold the top. So kind of like a wasted use of your money in my eyes. I think there's more efficient ways to do it. And that's where options come in. Can you close the chart for me for a moment? All right. I'm not suggesting that you buy options or sell options yet, but let's just talk about what they do when you want to. So for argument 6, if I want to spend the same $100, approximately $125, look in the middle there where it says strike price. Maybe you could put an arrow or something. Perfect. All right. So those are all the strikes that I get to buy Apple at. What strike do you want to pick? There's no wrong answer. Are we going to do a call on it or... Well, a call would be the right to do what? To buy. And if I wanted to do a put, it would be the right to sell. So a call on the dough platform is on the left. You can see where the circle where it says calls. And on the right, it says puts. So we're assuming that we're bullish on Apple. I was just using the example of buying one share of stock for $125. Let's go with that same outlook that we're bullish on Apple. And we want to buy a call. Well, there's a bunch of them up there from the 95 strike all the way up to the 165 strike. Where do you want to buy Apple? Say 130. Why'd you pick 130? Just curious. No wrong answer. Because it's a little over what the price is now. So that figured going higher. Okay. It's fair enough. Now, okay. So now, what if I told you you only had $125 to spend? Now what option you're going to trade? Well, I go for a 120 and save myself five bucks. Well, how would you pay 120? The 120 is trading for what price up there? 755. Right. So that's one option, $750. Now, I didn't tell you this was no way that you could know it. If I was to buy one option there, even though it says $7.50, it's not $7.50. We dropped the two zeros. It's actually $750. So you don't have enough money to do that. What option you're going to buy now? So I'd have to go at the 125 then. At least. Well, okay. So what's the, let's circle to 125? What's the 125 option paying trading for? At 435. So you have $435. You only have $100. Oh, I only have $100. You only have $100. So you buy a 135 or higher? Or higher, exactly. So you'd have to buy the 135 call or higher. Let's just use the 135 call at $100. What you're saying and what you're able to do is remember, an option is a contract. It's the right to do something. If you buy that option at a dollar, you have the right to buy Apple in a designated time, any time from today until 46 days. Can you circle the 46 days? Because we're looking at August options. And you can add more days on to that or... You could trade a different month. Right now we're trading in August. 46 days, you get to own Apple at 135. But you paid a dollar for that. You paid $100. So your break even on that trade is what? It's going to be 136. 136, exactly. So you spent $100. Same $100 if you were to buy Apple one share of stock. You're controlling 100 shares of stock. So instead of buying... I'm trying to show you a leverage here. Instead of buying one share at $125, you can rent out almost like... Have the right to buy 100 shares. But you got to buy those shares $135. And your cost basis is 136. Does that make sense? Yeah. Are you sure? Yes. All right, we'll go over this again. Now, I didn't get to everything I wanted to talk about today. So tomorrow we'll do again. The show is every day from 2 o'clock to 2.15. So let's put an up on our card on some of the things we talked about. And we'll get to the rest of them on Tuesday. Okay. So we looked at buying a call. We really only got to one example today. So buying a call you said to me was a bearishableish... There's a bullish strategy. Bullish strategy. We're buying a call. So if you buy a call, it must be a bullish strategy. If you sell a call... It's a bearish strategy. It's a bearish strategy. It's just the opposite. We haven't talked about puts yet, although I showed you where they were on the screen. So I'm going to save this and we're going to get back to it tomorrow. So all we did was we looked at $100. We have $100 to invest. Showed you what option you could buy. We didn't talk about making money or losing money. But we talked about leverage. One option controls... How many shares a stock? 100 shares. 100 shares a stock. All right. The only thing that's missing throughout everything that we're going to talk about for the coming year or two is confidence. And that's the only thing you need. Like you can learn the strategies. And there really are only a few. Every one of them is just a variation of another form of vertical spread or naked option. After that, it's just fancy names. The only piece that you'll be missing is confidence. Once you have confidence in the strategy, not whether you're going to be right or wrong on direction. But in the strategy, you become a successful trader and so will everybody else out there. Awesome. Good job, son. Tomorrow, thinking cap on, we're going to talk about puts, which is exactly the opposite of calls. Good job, buddy. Thank you.
