 That versus bat, where do I start? What's up my friend? How are you? Got my red on today trying to uh... Yeah, I'm trying to earn some brownie points with the ladies, listen Jenny, I mean come on. If the apple isn't falling far from the tree, that's my son sitting over there. So red shirt, red shirt Thursday, you put on a red shirt because you think you got a shot? I'll take my chances, I mean, that's good. That's good. Okay, okay. I wasn't able to crack that egg, but okay. Sounds good to me. Good for you. How's your day going? It's going well. It's been a little slower day today, but uh... it's been good. Okay, good. Good. And that's what... so how do you quantify a good day? I mean, a little slower, support wise. Okay, so we're a little bit slower support, but how do you quantify a good day? What made you a good day? Oh, well, in this, make money. Oh, okay. Making it, but at least going my direction or staying. I think you're actually making some money. Let's put your... you know what, let's... how about this? Let's use the other computer first, not yours, just because we can put some circles around some of the things and then we can look at it. So, yeah, put a circle. You're up $37.50. I mean, that was the right answer. For me, a good day and a bad day starts with how my trading account is doing. You're not doing it having a good day, right? Yeah. This is how this is going to go, huh? Yeah, today's a rough day for me. Yeah, today's a rough day. I got a little... got a little too large in Netflix. If I had traded my normal size, it would have just been, you know, a lousy day. I got a little too big. Size kills. Talk about it with you. You know, stay in mechanical, understanding what, you know, what the risks are. Keep you a number of occurrences up. You only have two number of occurrences. I have my number of occurrences up in my own account. But yeah, I broke the rules. Thought I saw something. Genius fails. Thought I saw something that was going to be great. I'm going to work it. I want to make it right. You're going to... you're just like you were working in Costco. Not adding to your position, but selling the put against the call you're making it work. So I'm going to do the same thing. But the first day, it's not a great feeling. You're not going to lie. No. You'll experience it someday. God willing you will. Yeah. Because you have to come in this business, any business. If you're opening up a convenience store in the corner, you know there are going to be days. And probably months when you know you don't make your knot or the customers don't come in or they go next door. Or you, you know, you zig when you should zag, you zig when you should zig. It happens. So far you're doing okay in both of your your your trades. TLT was one and Costco was the other. It looks like you're up around $12 for the day and you're up $38 total. On around $3,500 in overall risk in your account that you have. So you've made 1% or so or a tenth of a percent or so over the last couple of days. Pretty good. Okay. So what do you got from your day? What what do you bullish on? Today I wanted to look into since we always talk about gambling and my affinity for it. I wanted to go at L LVS at Las Vegas Sands Las Vegas Sands. Okay. All right. And so. So what's the what's the IVR in Las Vegas Sands the IVR rank? It's at 65. Okay. So definitely hits our range. Looking for high implied volatility that that works, right? When did this have earnings? I believe it was yesterday. See I don't know because we didn't if we click the E. Okay. At the top it'll give us a little drop down. So yeah. So it had earnings just yesterday that minus one days over the size. Okay. Okay. All right. So all right. So what do you what do you look at when you? Or so you bullish on it doesn't doesn't matter. It doesn't matter to me. Why? I mean doesn't matter me why or what? If I were to look at this stock let's just go to a chart of it real quick. Just to see where it's just to see where it's been. Nothing else than a visual of the last 30 days. Okay. So for the last 30 days or so it seems like it's about mid range. It's had a big drop off. Listen. I'm not reading into any of this. I don't trade Las Vegas Sands that much. We trade it. We trade it sometimes. Come on Anton. I think they're the 22nd. Okay. I thought so too because implied volatility is 48% 42% with July and eight days. So that's wrong on there. Want one shoot. Well the next thing I was going to do for you was close out there for a moment and let's see. Close up August and let's see the implied volatility on. It's not that it's not that great there. Let's see what eight days to go. Do you not have the weeklies up there? It has one day 36 days. Doesn't have any of the weekly. Let's change that. Thank you. Okay. There you go. Okay. So you see the eight day with that star there showing a high implied volatility of 45%. And then it slowly goes down to 413736. That kind of tells me that something's going to happen in that July expiration just because of a little bit higher. All right. All right. So could we back can we backtrack then? Okay. Since you made fun of me in Netflix. How about you get involved in Netflix? All right. Okay. But I want you to get involved with a debit spread. Okay. So yesterday we talked about a credit spread. Time flies. Yesterday we talked about a credit spread. What's a credit spread? Credit spread is when we are taking in credit for the trade. Okay. So it's the simultaneous buy and sell of two options to different options in the same month. You're selling a larger option and you're buying a smaller option to create a credit. A debit spread is exactly the opposite. You're buying an option that has it's higher in value say $5 and selling another option that has a lower value. Let's just say $3 and you're creating a debit. I paid five. I sold something at three. I'm creating a debit of two bucks. My risk then is $2 to find risk trade just like the credit spread. So you can use the same strikes and have a debit spread would be buying it and a credit spread would be selling it. Does it make sense? Okay. So Netflix up $17.90 everybody loves Netflix today. $8 expected move. It's two times the expected move. Presplit which was just yesterday. That's a well over $105 move on the stock. When it should only move about 50 bucks or so, 55 bucks. Tremendous move. Let's go to August. Put on a debit spread and let's just assume for a moment and I'm not bullish. Let's just assume for a moment you were bullish. If we were going to do a debit spread, we might look to buy an option that's one strike or two strikes or three strikes in the money and sell an option that's one strike two strikes or three strikes out in the money. Now these strikes are going to be a little bit messed up because you've got all these funky numbers to them. Let's do the 1520 call spread stock is 16 and change when we just stay on your computer just because we're there right now. Go to strategies, go to vertical, go to long call. So we're buying the 1520 call spread and it looks like it's trading for if we look on the right. Yeah, you're going to have to move them probably manually because he's just double clicking on it, clicking X and then you can click on selling. There you go. And what's a trading for $2.30? $2.30. We like to create a debit spread where we are paying no extrinsic value over the stock price. Can you so circle the stock price of 16, $1,16 and 17 cents? Okay. If I paid $2,030 for the spread, am I paying any extrinsic value over the price of the stock? You would be. Why? Because the right answer. The buy is below the strike or is below the current price and it's only $1.17. So you're paying $1.13 or what were we at? Perfect. It's the right answer. 100%. That's awesome. See now you understand spreads like you understand a credit and debit spread by that answer. By being able to answer that, you understand all vertical spreads. We want to create a spread where we would be paying a guess for that $5 wide spread where we're paying around $1.17 because then we wouldn't have any extrinsic value over the stock. That's awesome. Okay. Let's just take a quick look at what we talked about today or at least tried to talk about it. I know we got a little bit off track here. You can get off of your screen. Perfect. So a debit spread and I got this right from our glossary. If you go to the bottom of the tasty trade site, you can get these right yourself and see these. And there's a whole bunch of other terminologies that we have up there. A debit spread is just a spread that when it opens results in money being debited from your account. When we look to buy a debit spread, we don't look at what the delta is on the spread. We don't look at any of the strikes. We look at as a 50-50 probability with defined risk and we look to pay no extrinsic value or very little extrinsic value over the stock. A credit spread is exactly the opposite. It's a spread that when open results in a credit in your account and we like to collect how much? What percentage of the width of the strikes? 1-3. 1-3. That's it. Nothing else. Tomorrow we'll try to combine those. You don't have to put the card up. Tomorrow we'll try to combine those. If you combine a debit spread with a credit spread, you can create a butterfly. And then if you get really fancy, you can create a broken-wing butterfly. Which we'll do tomorrow in Netflix. Sound good? Cool. All right. Good job out of you. Tim Knight's next. He's live. I think for the first time, right? Yes. Good to be awesome. What do I normally say? Good job, son. Thanks.
